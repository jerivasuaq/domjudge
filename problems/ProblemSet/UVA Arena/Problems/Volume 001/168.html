<p>
Those of you with a classical education may remember the legend of
Theseus and the Minotaur. This is an unlikely tale involving a bull
headed monster, an underground maze full of twisty little passages all
alike, love-lorn damsels and balls of silk. In line with the
educational nature of this contest, we will now reveal the true story.
<p>
<p>
The maze was actually a series of caverns connected by reasonably
straight passages, some of which could only be traversed in one
direction. In order to trap the Minotaur, Theseus smuggled a large
supply of candles into the Labyrinth, as he had discovered that the
Minotaur was afraid of light. Theseus wandered around somewhat
aimlessly until he heard the Minotaur approaching along a tunnel. At
this point he lit a candle and set off in pursuit. The Minotaur
retreated into the cavern it had just left and fled by another
passage. Theseus followed, slowly gaining, until he reached the <i>k</i>'th
cavern since lighting the candle. Here he had enough time to place the
lighted candle in the middle of the cavern, light another one from it,
and continue the chase. As the chase progressed, a candle was left in
each <i>k</i>'th cavern passed through, thereby limiting the movement of the
Minotaur. Whenever the Minotaur entered a cavern, it would check the
exits in a particular order, fleeing down the first that did not lead
directly to a lit cavern. (Remember that as Theseus was carrying a lit
candle, the Minotaur never exited a cavern by the tunnel used to enter
it.) Eventually the Minotaur became trapped, enabling Theseus to
defeat it.
<p>
<p>
Consider the following Labyrinth as an example, where in this case the
Minotaur checks the exits from a cavern in alphabetical order:
<p>
<p> <img width="411" height="131" align="BOTTOM" alt="picture23" src="168img1.gif"> <p>
<p>
Assume that Theseus is in cavern C when he hears the Minotaur
approaching from A, and that for this scenario, the value of <i>k</i> is 3.
He lights a candle and gives chase, pursuing it through A, B, D
(leaves a candle), G, E, F (another candle), H, E, G (another), H, E
(trapped).
<p>
<p>
Write a program that will simulate Theseus's pursuit of the Minotaur.
The description of a labyrinth will identify each cavern by an upper
case character and will list the caverns reachable from that cavern in
the order that the Minotaur will attempt them, followed by the
identifiers for the caverns which the Minotaur and Theseus were in
when contact was first made, followed by the value of <i>k</i>. If a
cavern has no exit it may or may not be in the input.

<p>
Input will consist of a series of lines. Each line will describe a
scenario in the format shown below (which describes the above
example). No line will contain more than 255 characters. The file will
be terminated by a line consisting of a single <tt>#</tt>.
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</a></font></h2>
<p>
Output will consist of one line for each Labyrinth. Each line will
identify the lit caverns, in the order in which the candles were left,
and the cavern in which the Minotaur was trapped, following the format
shown in the example below.
