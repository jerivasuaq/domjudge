In 1979, Dan Bricklin and Bob Frankston wrote VisiCalc, the first spreadsheet
application. It became a huge success and, at that time, was the killer
application for the Apple II computers. Today, spreadsheets are found on
most desktop computers.

<p>
The idea behind spreadsheets is very simple, though powerful. A spreadsheet
consists of a table where each cell contains either a number or a formula.
A formula can compute an expression that depends on the values of other
cells. Text and graphics can be added for presentation purposes.
<p>
<p>
You are to write a very simple spreadsheet application. Your program should
accept several spreadsheets. Each cell of the spreadsheet contains either
a numeric value (integers only) or a formula, which only support sums. After
having computed the values of all formulas, your program should output the
resulting spreadsheet where all formulas have been replaced by their value.

<p>
The first line of the input file contains the number of spreadsheets to
follow. A spreadsheet starts with a line consisting of two integer numbers,
separated by a space, giving the number of columns and rows. The following
lines of the spreadsheet each contain a row. A row consists of the cells
of that row, separated by a single space.
<p>
<p>
A cell consists either of a numeric integer value or of a formula. A formula
starts with an equal sign (<tt>=</tt>). After that, one or more cell names follow,
separated by plus signs (<tt>+</tt>). The value of such a formula is the sum of all
values found in the referenced cells. These cells may again contain a formula.
There are no spaces within a formula.
<p>
You may safely assume that there are no cyclic dependencies between cells.
So each spreadsheet can be fully computed.
<p>
<p>
The name of a cell consists of one to three letters for the column followed
by a number between 1 and 999 (including) for the row. The letters for the
column form the following series: A, B, C, ..., Z, AA, AB, AC, ..., AZ,
BA, ..., BZ, CA, ..., ZZ, AAA, AAB, ..., AAZ, ABA, ..., ABZ, ACA, ...,
ZZZ. These letters correspond to the number from 1 to 18278. The top left
cell has the name <tt>A1</tt>. See figure 1.

<p>
The output of your program should have the same format as the input, except
that the number of spreadsheets and the number of columns and rows are not
repeated. Furthermore, all formulas should be replaced by their value.
