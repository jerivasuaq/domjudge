<p>
Some problems are difficult to solve but have a simplification that is
easy to solve.  Rather than deal with the difficulties of constructing a
model of the Earth (a somewhat oblate spheroid),
consider a pre-Columbian flat world that is a 500 kilometer  <img width="9" height="18" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline41" src="109img1.gif">  500
kilometer square.
<p>
In the model used in this problem, the flat world consists of several
warring kingdoms.  Though warlike, the people of the world are strict
isolationists; each kingdom is surrounded by a high (but thin) wall
designed to both protect the kingdom and to isolate it.  To avoid fights
for power, each kingdom has its own electric power plant.
<p>
When the urge to fight becomes too great, the people of a kingdom often
launch missiles at other kingdoms.  Each SCUD missile (Sanitary
Cleansing Universal Destroyer) that
lands within the walls of a kingdom destroys that kingdom's power plant
(without loss of life).
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">The Problem</a></font></h2>
<p>
Given coordinate locations of several kingdoms (by specifying
the locations of houses and
the location of the power plant in a kingdom) and missile landings you
are to write a program that determines the total area of all kingdoms
that are without power after an exchange of missile fire.
<p>
In the simple world of this problem kingdoms do not overlap.
Furthermore, the walls surrounding each kingdom are considered to be of
zero thickness.  The wall surrounding a kingdom is the minimal-perimeter
wall that completely surrounds all the houses and the power station
that comprise a kingdom;
the area of a kingdom is the area enclosed by the minimal-perimeter thin
wall.
<p>
There is exactly one power station per
kingdom.
<p>
There may be empty space between kingdoms.
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001003000000000000000">The Input</a></font></h2>
<p>
The input is a sequence of kingdom specifications followed by a sequence
of missile landing locations.
<p>
A kingdom is specified by a number <i>N</i> ( <img width="96" height="26" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline45" src="109img2.gif"> ) on a
single line which
indicates the number of sites in this kingdom.  The next
line contains the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> coordinates of the power station,
followed by <i>N</i>-1 lines of <i>x</i>, <i>y</i> pairs indicating the locations of
homes served by this power station.  A value of -1 for <i>N</i> indicates
that there are no more kingdoms.  There will be at least one kingdom
in the data set.
<p>
Following the last kingdom specification will be the coordinates of
one or more missile attacks, indicating the location of a missile
landing.  Each missile location is on a line by itself.  You are to
process missile attacks until you reach the end of the file.
<p>
Locations are specified in kilometers using coordinates on a 500 km by
500 km grid.  All coordinates will be integers between 0 and 500
inclusive.  Coordinates are specified as a pair of integers separated
by white-space on a single line.  The input file will consist of up to
20 kingdoms, followed by any number of missile attacks.
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001004000000000000000">The Output</a></font></h2>
<p>
The output consists of a single number representing the total area of
all kingdoms without electricity after all missile attacks have been
processed.  The number should be printed with (and correct to) two
decimal places.

<p>
You may or may not find the following formula useful.
<p>
Given a polygon described by the vertices  <img width="94" height="17" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline61" src="109img3.gif">  such that  <img width="55" height="17" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline63" src="109img4.gif"> , the signed area of the polygon is given by
<p> <img width="354" height="45" align="BOTTOM" alt="displaymath59" src="109img5.gif"> <p>
where  the x, y
coordinates of  <img width="85" height="27" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline65" src="109img6.gif"> ; the edges of the polygon are from  <img width="11" height="17" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline67" src="109img7.gif">  to
 <img width="29" height="18" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline69" src="109img8.gif">  for  <img width="103" height="24" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline71" src="109img9.gif"> .
<p>
If the points describing the polygon are given
in a counterclockwise direction, the value of <i>a</i> will be positive,
and if the points of the polygon are listed in a clockwise direction,
the value of <i>a</i> will be negative.
