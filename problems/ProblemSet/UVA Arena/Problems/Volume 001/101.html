Background</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
Many areas of Computer Science use simple, abstract domains 
for both analytical and empirical studies.  For example, an early AI
study of planning and robotics (STRIPS) used a block world in which a
robot arm performed tasks involving the manipulation of blocks.  

<p>
In this
problem you will model a simple block world under certain rules and
constraints.  Rather than determine how to achieve a specified state,
you will ``program'' a robotic arm to respond to a limited set of commands.

<p>

<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">
The Problem</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
The problem is to parse a series of commands that instruct a robot arm
in how to manipulate blocks that lie on a flat table.  Initially there
are <i>n</i> blocks on the table (numbered from 0 to <i>n</i>-1)
with block <i>b</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> adjacent to block <i>b</i><sub><i>i</i>+1</sub>
for all 

<img width="106" height="31" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="101img1.gif" alt="$0 \leq i < n-1$">
as shown in the diagram below:

<div align="CENTER"><a name="74">&#160;</a>

<strong>Figure:</strong>
Initial Blocks World
</div>
<br>

<p>
The valid commands for the robot arm that manipulates blocks are:
<ul>
<li>move <i>a</i> onto <i>b</i> 

<p>
where <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are block numbers, puts block <i>a</i> onto block <i>b</i> after
returning any blocks that are stacked on top of blocks <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> to
their initial positions.  

<p>
<li>move <i>a</i> over <i>b</i>

<p>
where <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are block numbers, puts block <i>a</i> onto the top of the
stack containing block <i>b</i>, after returning any blocks that are stacked
on top of block <i>a</i> to their initial positions.

<p>
<li>pile <i>a</i> onto <i>b</i>

<p>
where <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are block numbers, moves the pile of blocks consisting
of block <i>a</i>,  and any blocks that are stacked above block <i>a</i>, onto
block <i>b</i>.  All blocks on top of block <i>b</i> are moved to their initial
positions prior to the pile taking place.  The blocks stacked above block
<i>a</i> retain their order when moved.

<p>
<li>pile <i>a</i> over <i>b</i>

<p>
where <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are block numbers, puts the pile of blocks consisting
of block <i>a</i>, and any blocks that are stacked above  block <i>a</i>, onto
the top of the stack containing block <i>b</i>.  The blocks stacked above block
<i>a</i> retain their original order when moved.  

<p>
<li>quit

<p>
terminates manipulations in the block world.
</li></li></li></li></li></ul>

<p>
Any command in which <i>a</i> = <i>b</i> or in which <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>
are in the same stack of blocks is an illegal command.  All illegal
commands should be ignored and should have no
affect on the configuration of blocks. 

<p>

<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001003000000000000000">
The Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
The input begins with an integer <i>n</i> on a line by itself representing
the number of blocks in the block world.  You may assume that 

0 &lt; <i>n</i> &lt;
25.

<p>
The number of blocks is followed by a sequence of block commands, one
command per line.  Your
program should process all commands until the <tt>quit</tt> command is
encountered.

<p>
You may assume that all commands will be of the form specified above.
There will be no syntactically incorrect commands.

<p>

<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001004000000000000000">
The Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>
The output should consist of the final state of the blocks world.  Each
original block position numbered <i>i</i> 
(

<img width="76" height="31" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="101img4.gif" alt="$0 \leq i < n$">
where <i>n</i> is the number of blocks) should appear
followed immediately by a colon.
If there is at least a block
on it, the colon must be followed by one space, followed by a list of 
blocks that appear stacked in that position with each block number 
separated from other block numbers by a space. Don't put any trailing 
spaces on a line. 

<p>
There should be one line of output for each block position
(i.e., <i>n</i> lines of output where <i>n</i> is the 
integer on the first line of input).
