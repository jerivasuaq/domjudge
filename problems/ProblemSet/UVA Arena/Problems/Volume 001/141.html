<p>
The game of Spot is played on an NxN board as shown below for N = 4.
During the game, alternate players may either place a black counter
(spot) in an empty square or remove one from the board, thus producing
a variety of patterns. If a board pattern (or its rotation by
90 degrees or 180 degrees) is repeated during a game, the player
producing that pattern loses and the other player wins. The game
terminates in a draw after 2N moves if no duplicate pattern is
produced before then.
<p>
Consider the following patterns:

If the first pattern had been produced earlier, then any of the
following three patterns (plus one other not shown) would terminate
the game, whereas the last one would not.

<p>
Input will consist of a series of games, each consisting of the size
of the board, N (2  <img width="11" height="24" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline180" src="141img2.gif">  N  <img width="11" height="24" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline180" src="141img2.gif">  50) followed, on separate lines, by
2N moves, whether they are all necessary or not. Each move will
consist of the coordinates of a square (integers in the range 1..N)
followed by a blank and a character `+' or `-' indicating the addition
or removal of a spot respectively. You may assume that all moves are
legal, that is there will never be an attempt to place a spot on an
occupied square, nor to remove a non-existent spot. Input
will be terminated by a zero (0).
<p>
<p>
Output will consist of one line for each game indicating which player
won and on which move, or that the game ended in a draw.
