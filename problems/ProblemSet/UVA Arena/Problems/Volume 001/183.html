The bitmap is a data structure that arises in many areas of computing.
In the area of graphics, for example, a bitmap can represent an image
by having a 1 represent a black pixel and a 0 represent a white pixel.
<p>
<p>
Consider the following two ways of representing a rectangular bit map.
In the first, it is simply represented as a two dimensional array of
<tt>1</tt>s and <tt>0</tt>s. The second is based on a decomposition technique. First,
the entire bit map is considered. If all bits within it are 1, a <tt>1</tt> is
output. If all bits within it are 0, a <tt>0</tt> is output. Otherwise, a <tt>D</tt> is
output, the bit map is divided into quarters (as described below), and
each of those is processed in the same way as the original bit map.
The quarters are processed in top left, top right, bottom left, bottom
right order. Where a bit map being divided has an even number of rows
and an even number of columns, all quarters have the same dimensions.
Where the number of columns is odd, the left quarters have one more
column than the right. Where the number of rows is odd the top
quarters have one more row than the bottom. Note that if a region
having only one row or one column is divided then two halves result,
with the top half processed before the bottom where a single column is
divided, and the left half before the right if a single row is
divided.
<p>
<p>
Write a program that will read in bitmaps of either form and transform
them to the other form.

<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</a></font></h2>
<p>
Input will consist of a series of bit maps. Each bit map begins with a
line giving its format (``<tt>B</tt>'' or ``<tt>D</tt>'') and its dimensions (rows and
columns). Neither dimension will be greater than 200. There will be at
least one space between each of the items of information. Following
this line will be one or more lines containing the sequence of ``<tt>1</tt>'',
``<tt>0</tt>'' and ``<tt>D</tt>'' characters that represent the bit map, with no intervening
spaces. Each line (except the last, which may be shorter) will contain
50 characters. A ``<tt>B</tt>'' type bitmap will be written left to right, top to
bottom. The file will be terminated by a line consisting of a single
<tt>#</tt>.
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</a></font></h2>
<p>
Output will consist of a series of bitmaps, one for each bit map of the input. Output of each bit map begins on a new line and will be in the same format as the input. The width and height are to be output right justified in fields of width four.
