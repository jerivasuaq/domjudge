<p>
Trees are fundamental in many branches of computer science.  Current state-of-the art parallel computers such
as Thinking Machines' CM-5 are based on <em>fat trees</em>.  Quad- and
octal-trees are fundamental to many algorithms in computer graphics.
<p>
This problem involves building and traversing binary trees.
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">The Problem</a></font></h2>
<p>
Given a sequence of binary trees, you are to write a program that prints
a level-order traversal of each tree.  In this problem each node of a
binary tree contains a positive integer and all binary trees have
have fewer than 256 nodes.
<p>
In a <em>level-order</em> traversal of a tree, the data in all nodes at a
given level are printed in left-to-right order and all nodes at level
<i>k</i> are printed before all nodes at level <i>k</i>+1.
<p>
For example, a level order traversal of the tree 
<p> <img width="290" height="226" align="BOTTOM" alt="picture28" src="122img1.gif"> <p>
<p>
is: 5, 4, 8, 11, 13, 4, 7, 2, 1.
<p>
In this problem a binary tree is specified by a sequence of pairs
(<i>n</i>,<i>s</i>) where <i>n</i> is the value at the node whose path from the root is
given by the string <i>s</i>.  A path is given be a sequence of <em>L</em>'s and
<em>R</em>'s where <em>L</em> indicates a left branch and <em>R</em> indicates a
right branch.  In the tree diagrammed above, the node containing 13 is
specified by (13,RL), and the node containing 2 is specified by (2,LLR).
The root node is specified by (5,) where the empty string indicates the
path from the root to itself.  A binary tree is considered to be
<em>completely specified</em> if every node on all root-to-node paths in
the tree is given a value exactly once.
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001003000000000000000">The Input</a></font></h2>
<p>
The input is a sequence of binary trees specified as described above.
Each tree in a sequence consists of several pairs (<i>n</i>,<i>s</i>) as described
above separated by whitespace.  The last entry in each tree is ().  No
whitespace appears between left and right parentheses.
<p>
All nodes contain a positive integer.  Every tree in the input will
consist of at least one node and no more than 256 nodes.  Input is
terminated by end-of-file.
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001004000000000000000">The Output</a></font></h2>
<p>
For each completely specified binary tree in the input file, the level
order traversal of that tree should be printed.  If a tree is not
completely specified, i.e., some node in the tree is NOT given a value
or a node is given a value more than once, then the string ``not
complete'' should be printed.
