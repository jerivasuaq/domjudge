<p>
Calculator Language (CL) supports assignment, positive and negative
integers and simple arithmetic. The allowable characters in a CL
statement are thus:

<p>
<p>
All operators have the same precedence and are right associative, thus
15 - 8 - 3 = 15 - (8 - 3) = 10. As one would expect, brackets will
force the expression within them to be evaluated first. Brackets may
be nested arbitrarily deeply. An expression never has two operators
next to each other (even if separated by a bracket), an assignment
operator is always immediately preceded by a variable and the leftmost
operator on a line is always an assignment. For readability, spaces
may be freely inserted into an expression, except between a negative
sign and a number. A negative sign will not appear before a variable.
All variables are initialised to zero (0) and retain their values
until changed explicitly.

<p>
Write a program that will accept and evaluate expressions written in
this language. Each expression occupies one line and contains at least
one assignment operator, and maybe more.

<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</a></font></h2>
<p>
Input will consist of a series of lines, each line containing a
correct CL expression. No line will be longer than 100 characters. The
file will be terminated by a line consisting of a single <tt>#</tt>.
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</a></font></h2>
<p>
Output will consist of a series of lines, one for each line of the
input. Each line will consist of a list of the final values of all
variables whose value changes as a result of the evaluation of that
expression. If more than one variable changes value, they should be
listed in alphabetical order, separated by commas. If a variable
changes value more than once in an expression, only the final value is
output. A variable is said to change value if its value after the
expression has been evaluated is different from its value before the
expression was evaluated. If no variables change value, then print the
message `<tt>No Change</tt>'. Follow the format shown below exactly.
