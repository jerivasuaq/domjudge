A typical windowing system on a computer will provide a number of
icons on the screen as well as some defined regions. When the mouse
button is clicked, the system has to determine where the cursor is and
what is being selected. For this problem we assume that a mouse click
in (or on the border of) a region selects that region, otherwise it
selects the closest visible icon (or icons in the case of a tie).
<p>
<p>
Consider the following screen:
<p>
<p> <img align="BOTTOM" alt="picture23" src="142img1.gif"> <p>
<p>
A mouse click at `a' will select region A. A mouse click at `b' will
select icon 1. A mouse click at `c' will select icons 6 and 7. A mouse
click at `d' is ambiguous. The ambiguity is resolved by assuming that
one region is in front of another. In the data files, later regions
can be assumed to be in front of earlier regions. Since regions are
labelled in order of appearance (see later) `d' will select C. Note
that regions always overlap icons so that obscured icons need not be
considered and that the origin (0,0) is at the top left corner.
<p>
<p>
Write a program that will read in a series of region and icon
definitions followed by a series of mouse clicks and return the
selected items. Coordinates will be given as pairs of integers in the
range 0..499 and you can assume that all icons and regions lie wholly
within the screen. Your program must number all icons (even invisible
ones) in the order of arrival starting from 1 and label regions
alphabetically in the order of arrival starting from `A'.
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</a></font></h2>
<p>
Input will consist of a series of lines. Each line will identify the
type of data: I for icon, R for region and M for mouse click. There
will be no separation between the specification part and the event
part, however no icon or region specifications will follow the first
mouse click. An I will be followed by the coordinates of the centre of
the icon, R will be followed by the coordinates of the top left and
bottom right corners respectively and M will be followed by the
coordinates of the cursor at the time of the click. There will always
be at least one visible icon and never more than 25 regions and 50
icons. The entire file will be terminated by a line consisting of a
single <tt>#</tt>.
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</a></font></h2>
<p>
Output will consist of one line for each mouse click, containing the
selection(s) for that click. Regions will be identified by their
single character identifier, icon numbers will be written out right
justified in a field of width 3, and where there is more than one
icon number they will appear in increasing numerical order.
