Most US cities are constructed according to a very simple plan--they
have Avenues running north and south, and Streets running east and
west, enclosing square blocks. Avenues and Streets are numbered, with
numbers increasing westward and southward. There are 50 driveways on
each side of a block, numbered 00 to 98 on one side and 01 to 99 on
the other. House numbers increase in the same directions as Street and
Avenue numbers. If you are travelling in the direction of increasing
numbers then odd numbers are on your right. Thus the house at 1288
16th Street (S16 1288) is located on 16th Street, west of 12th Avenue
and east of 13th Avenue, and is on the right-hand side going east. The
residence described as A11 1543 lies on 11th Avenue, south of 15th
Street and north of 16th Street, and is on the right-hand side going
south. Both of these are marked on the following typical street map:

Quiet suburbs are formed by the simple expedient of making some
Avenues and Streets discontinuous as shown above. Note that Avenues
and Streets keep the same name, even when there are places where they
simply don't exist. It is difficult to get lost in such a city, as the
address tells you exactly where to go. However, if you don't know the
pattern of missing portions, you can spend a lot of time going into
dead-end roads.
<p>
<p>
Write a program that will firstly read in a description of the
`missing' areas in a city and then a series of pairs of addresses,
where an address is assumed to specify a driveway not necessarily a
residence. For each pair of addresses the program must calculate the
distance between them, by the shortest legal route. The distance is
the number of driveways you pass (on your side of the road) excluding
the source and destination. You may make the following assumptions:
<p>
<ul><li> You drive on the right hand side of the road.<li> You may not cross a lane of traffic except at an intersection,
that is you must turn right when entering or leaving a driveway.<li> Driveways are located in the centres of their sections.<li> U-turns are illegal except at the end of cul de sacs.<li> Streets and Avenues are numbered from 00 to 49 and there are no roads
beyond these bounds; however there are driveways on both sides of the
bounding roads.<li> Sections on corners have two driveways.<li> A route exists between any pair of driveways.

<p>
Input will be divided into two portions: a ``missing road'' portion
and an address portion, each terminated by a line consisting of a
single `<tt>#</tt>'. The ``missing road'' portion consists of a series of lines
with each line containing a road identifier and a pair of house
numbers. A road identifier is an `<tt>A</tt>' or an `<tt>S</tt>' (specifying an Avenue
or a Street) followed by a number in the range 00 to 49. A house
number is an even number in the range 0000 to 4898. The area between
and including the specified numbers on the identified road is
inaccessible. Note that the line goes directly across the street, thus
if number 1612 is inaccessible, then so is 1613. Inaccessible portions
run from the borders of sections not from driveways. There will be
exactly one space separating parts of the input.
<p>
<p>
The address portion consists of a series of lines each line containing
two addresses. An address is a road identifier (as above) followed by
a number in the range 0000 to 4899. There will be exactly one space
separating parts of the input.
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</a></font></h2>
<p>
Output consists of a series of lines, one for each line in the address
portion of the input file. Each line contains the distance between the
two houses specified in the input (the number of driveways passed)
written as an integer, left justified.
