It is the year 2126 and comet Swift-Tuttle has struck the earth as
predicted. The resultant explosion emits a large cloud of high energy
neutrons that eliminates all human life. The accompanying
electro-magnetic storm causes two unusual events: many of the links
between various parts of the electronic network are severed, and some
postgraduate AI projects begin to merge and mutate, in much the same
way as animal life did several million years ago. In a very short time
two programs emerge, Paskill and Lisper, which move through the
network marking each node they visit: Paskill activates a modified
Prolog interpreter and Lisper activates the `Hello World' program.
However `Hello World' has mutated into an endless loop that so ties up
the node that no other program, not even Lisper, can re-enter that
node and the Prolog interpreter immediately reverse compiles (and
destroys) any program that enters. However, Paskill knows which nodes
it has visited and never tries to re-enter them. Thus if Lisper
attempts to enter a node already visited by Paskill it will be
annihilated; neither can enter a node already visited by Lisper, if
either (or both) cannot move both will halt and if they ever arrive at
a node simultaneously they annihilate each other. Both programs move
through the network at the same speed.
<p>
<p>
Write a program to simulate these events. All nodes in the the network
are labelled with a single uppercase letter as shown below. When
moving to the next node, Paskill searches alphabetically forwards from
the current node, whereas Lisper searches alphabetically backwards
from the current node, both wrapping round if necessary. Thus, (in the
absence of the other) if Paskill enters the network below at A, it
would visit the nodes in the order A, B, C, D, G, H, E, F; if Lisper
enters the network at H it would visit them in the order H, G, E, F.
Simulation stops when one or more of the above events occurs. If more
than one event occurs, mention Paskill first.

<p>
Input will consist of a series of lines. Each line will describe a
network and indicate the starting nodes for the two programs. A
network is described as a series of nodes separated by `<tt>;</tt>' and
terminated by a period (`<tt>.</tt>').  Each node is described by its
identifier, a `<tt>:</tt>' and one or more of the nodes connected to it. Each
link will be mentioned at least once, as will each node, although not
all nodes will be `described'. After the period will appear the labels
of the starting nodes--first Paskill and then Lisper. No line will
contain more than 255 characters. The file will be terminated by a
line consisting of a single <tt>#</tt>.

<p>
Output will consist of one line for each network. Each line will
specify the terminating event and the node where it occurs. The
terminating event is one or two of the following:
<p>
<ul><li> Lisper destroyed in node ?<li> {Paskill/Lisper} trapped in node ?<li> Both annihilated in node ?
</li></li></li></ul><h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001003000000000000000">Sample input</a></font></h2>
