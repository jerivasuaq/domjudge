Searching and sorting are part of the theory and practice of computer
science.  For example, binary search provides a good example of an
easy-to-understand algorithm with sub-linear complexity.  Quicksort is
an efficient  <img width="74" height="27" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline29" src="123img1.gif">  [average case] comparison based sort.
<p>
KWIC-indexing is an indexing method that permits efficient ``human
search'' of, for example, a list of titles.
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">The Problem</a></font></h2>
<p>
Given a list of titles and a list of ``words to ignore'', you are to
write a program that generates a KWIC (Key Word In Context) index of the
titles.  In a KWIC-index, a title is listed once for each keyword that
occurs in the title.  The KWIC-index is alphabetized by keyword.
<p>
Any word that is not one of the ``words to ignore'' is a potential
keyword.
<p>
For example, if words to ignore are
``<code>the, of, and, as, a</code>'' and the list
of titles is:
<pre>Descent of Man
The Ascent of Man
The Old Man and The Sea
A Portrait of The Artist As a Young Man</pre>
<p>
A KWIC-index of these titles might be given by:
<p>
<pre>                      a portrait of the ARTIST as a young man 
                                    the ASCENT of man 
                                        DESCENT of man 
                             descent of MAN 
                          the ascent of MAN 
                                the old MAN and the sea 
    a portrait of the artist as a young MAN 
                                    the OLD man and the sea 
                                      a PORTRAIT of the artist as a young man 
                    the old man and the SEA 
          a portrait of the artist as a YOUNG man</pre>
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001003000000000000000">The Input</a></font></h2>
<p>
The input is a sequence of lines, the string <code>::</code> is used to
separate the list of words to ignore from the list of titles.  Each of
the words to ignore appears in lower-case letters on a line by itself
and is no more than 10 characters in length.  Each title appears on a
line by itself and may consist of mixed-case (upper and lower) letters.
Words in a title are separated by whitespace.  No title contains more
than 15 words.
<p>
There will be no more than 50 words to ignore, no more than than 200
titles, and no more than 10,000 characters in the titles and words to
ignore combined.  No characters other than 'a'-'z', 'A'-'Z', and white
space will appear in the input.
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001004000000000000000">The Output</a></font></h2>
<p>
The output should be a KWIC-index of the titles, with each title
appearing once for each keyword in the title, and with the KWIC-index
alphabetized by keyword.  If a word appears more than once in a title,
each instance is a potential keyword.
<p>
The keyword should appear in all upper-case
letters. All other words in a title should be in lower-case letters.
Titles in the KWIC-index with the same keyword should appear in the same
order as they appeared in the input file.  In the case where multiple
instances of a word are keywords in the same title, the keywords should
be capitalized in left-to-right order.
<p>
Case (upper or lower) is irrelevant when determining if a word is to be
ignored.
<p>
The titles in the KWIC-index need NOT be justified or aligned by
keyword, all titles may be listed left-justified.
