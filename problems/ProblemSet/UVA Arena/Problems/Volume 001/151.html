<p>
During the power crisis in New Zealand this winter (caused by a
shortage of rain and hence low levels in the hydro dams), a
contingency scheme was developed to turn off the power to areas of the
country in a systematic, totally fair, manner. The country was divided
up into <i>N</i> regions (Auckland was region number 1, and Wellington number
13). A number, <i>m</i>, would be picked `at random', and the power would
first be turned off in region 1 (clearly the fairest starting point)
and then in every m'th region after that, wrapping around to 1 after
<i>N</i>, and ignoring regions already turned off. For example, if <i>N</i> = 17 and
<i>m</i> = 5, power would be turned off to the regions in the
order:1,6,11,16,5,12,2,9,17,10,4,15,14,3,8,13,7.
<p>
<p>
The problem is that it is clearly fairest to turn off Wellington last
(after all, that is where the Electricity headquarters are), so for a
given <i>N</i>, the `random' number <i>m</i> needs to be carefully chosen so that
region 13 is the last region selected.
<p>
<p>
Write a program that will read in the number of regions and then
determine the smallest number <i>m</i> that will ensure that Wellington
(region 13) can function while the rest of the country is blacked out.

<p>
Input will consist of a
series of lines, each line containing the number of regions (<i>N</i>) with
 <img width="104" height="26" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline42" src="151img1.gif"> . The file will be terminated by a line consisting of
a single 0.
<p>
<p>
Output will consist of a series of lines, one for each line of the
input. Each line will consist of the number <i>m</i> according to the above
scheme.
