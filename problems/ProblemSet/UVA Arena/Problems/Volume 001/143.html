An Orchardist has planted an orchard in a rectangle with trees
uniformly spaced in both directions. Thus the trees form a rectangular
grid and we can consider the trees to have integer coordinates. The
origin of the coordinate system is at the bottom left of the following
diagram:

<p>
Consider that we now overlay a series of triangles on to this grid.
The vertices of the triangle can have any real coordinates in the
range 0.0 to 100.0, thus trees can have coordinates in the range 1 to
99. Two possible triangles are shown.
<p>
<p>
Write a program that will determine how many trees are contained
within a given triangle. For the purposes of this problem, you may
assume that the trees are of point size, and that any tree (point)
lying exactly on the border of a triangle is considered to be in the
triangle.

<p>
Input will consist of a series of lines. Each line will contain 6 real
numbers in the range 0.00 to 100.00 representing the coordinates of a
triangle. The entire file will be terminated by a line containing 6
zeroes (0 0 0 0 0 0).
<p>
<p>
Output will consist of one line for each triangle, containing the
number of trees for that triangle right justified in a field of width
4.
