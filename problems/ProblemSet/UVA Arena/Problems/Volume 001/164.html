Extel have just brought out their newest computer, a string processing
computer dubbed the X9091. It is hoped that it will have some value in
cryptography and related fields. (It is rumoured that the Taiwanese
are working on a clone that will correct Stage 1 essays, but we will
ignore such vapourware). This computer will accept input strings and
produce output strings from them, depending on the programs loaded
into them at the time. The chip is the ultimate in RISC
technology--it has only three transformation instructions:
<p>
<ul><li> Delete a character at a particular position.<li> Insert a character at a particular position.<li> Change the character at a particular position to a different character.
</li></li></li></ul>
<p>
Programs for this machine are written in a form of machine code where
each instruction has the format <tt>ZXdd--Z</tt> represents the code for the
instruction (<tt>D</tt>, <tt>I</tt> or <tt>C</tt>), <tt>X</tt> is a character and <tt>dd</tt>
represents a two
digit number. A program is terminated by a special halt instruction
consisting of the letter `<tt>E</tt>'. Note that each instruction works on the
string in memory at the time the instruction is executed.
<p>
To see how this all works consider the following example. It is
desired to transform the string `<tt>abcde</tt>' to the string `<tt>bcgfe</tt>'. This
could be achieved by a series of Change commands, but is not minimal.
The following program is better.

Write a program that will read in two strings (the input string and
the target string) and will produce a <em>minimal</em> X9091 program necessary
to transform the input string into the target string. Since there may
be multiple solutions, only one should be produced. Any solution that
satisfies these criteria will be accepted.

<p>
Input will consist of a series of lines, each line containing two
strings separated by exactly one space. The strings will consist of no
more than 20 lower case characters. The file will be terminated by a
line consisting of a single <tt>#</tt>.
<p>
Output will consist of a series of lines, one for each line of the
input. Each will consist of a program in X9091 language.
