<p>
In 5-card draw poker, a player is dealt a hand of five cards (which may be 
looked at).  The player may then discard between zero and five of his or her 
cards and have them replaced by the same number of cards from the top of 
the deck (which is face down).  The object is to maximize the value of the 
final hand.  The different values of hands in poker are given at the end of 
this problem.
<p>
Normally the player cannot see the cards in the deck and so must use 
probability to decide which cards to discard.  In this problem, we imagine 
that the poker player is psychic and knows which cards are on top of the 
deck.  Write a program which advises the player which cards to discard so 
as to maximize the value of the resulting hand.

<p>
Input will consist of a series of lines, each containing the initial
five cards in the hand then the first five cards on top of the deck.
Each card is represented as a two-character code.  The first character
is the face-value (A=Ace, 2-9, T=10, J=Jack, Q=Queen, K=King) and the
second character is the suit (C=Clubs, D=Diamonds, H=Hearts,
S=Spades).  Cards will be separated by single spaces.  Each input line
will be from a single valid deck, that is there will be no duplicate
cards in each hand and deck.
<p>
Each line of input should produce one line of output, consisting of
the initial hand, the top five cards on the deck, and the best value
of hand that is possible.  Input is terminated by end of file.
<p>
<p>
Use the sample input and output as a guide. Note that the order of the cards in the player's hand is irrelevant, but the 
order of the cards in the deck is important because the discarded cards must 
be replaced from the top of the deck.  Also note that examples of all types 
of hands appear in the sample output, with the hands shown in decreasing 
order of value.
