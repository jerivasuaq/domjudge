One way of achieving a smooth and economical drive to work is to
`catch' every traffic light, that is have every signal
change to green as you approach it. One day you notice as you come
over the brow of a hill that every traffic light you can see has just
changed to green and that therefore your chances of catching every
signal is slight. As you wait at a red light you begin to wonder how
long it will be before all the lights again show green, not
necessarily all turn green, merely all show green simultaneously, even
if it is only for a second.
<p>
<p>
Write a program that will determine whether this event occurs within a
reasonable time. Time is measured from the instant when they all
turned green simultaneously, although the initial portion while they
are all still green is excluded from the reckoning.

<p>
Input will consist of a series of scenarios. Data for each scenario
will consist of a series of integers representing the cycle times of
the traffic lights, possibly spread over many lines, with no line
being longer than 100 characters. Each number represents the cycle
time of a single signal.  The cycle time is the time that traffic may
move in one direction; note that the last 5 seconds of a green cycle
is actually orange. Thus the number 25 means a signal that (for a
particular direction) will spend 20 seconds green, 5 seconds orange
and 25 seconds red. Cycle times will not be less than 10 seconds, nor
more than 90 seconds.  There will always be at least two signals in a
scenario and never more than 100. Each scenario will be terminated by
a zero (0). The file will be terminated by a line consisting of three
zeroes (0 0 0).

<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</a></font></h2>
<p>
Output will consist of a series of lines, one for each scenario in the
input. Each line will consist of the time in hours, minutes and
seconds that it takes for all the signals to show green again after at
least one of them changes to orange. Follow the format shown in the
examples. Time is measured from the instant they all turn green
simultaneously. If it takes more than five hours before they all show
green simultaneously, the message ``<tt>Signals fail to synchronise
in 5 hours</tt>'' should be written instead.
