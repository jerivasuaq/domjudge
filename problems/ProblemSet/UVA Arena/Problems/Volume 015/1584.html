<p>
Some DNA sequences exist in circular forms as in the following figure, which shows a circular sequence 
``CGAGTCAGCT", that is, the last symbol ``T" in ``CGAGTCAGCT" is connected to the first symbol ``C". We always read a circular sequence in the clockwise direction.

<p>
Since it is not easy to store a circular sequence in a computer as it is, we decided to store it as a linear 
sequence. However, there can be many linear sequences that are obtained from a circular sequence by cutting 
any  place  of  the  circular  sequence.  Hence,  we  also  decided  to  store  the  linear  sequence  that  is 
lexicographically smallest among all linear sequences that can be obtained from a circular sequence. 

<p>
Your task is to find the lexicographically smallest sequence from a given circular sequence. For the example 
in  the  figure,  the  lexicographically  smallest  sequence  is  ``AGCTCGAGTC".  If  there  are  two  or  more  linear 
sequences that are lexicographically smallest, you are to find any one of them (in fact, they are the same).

</h2> 

<p>
The input consists of <span class="MATH"><i>T</i></span> test cases. The number of test cases <span class="MATH"><i>T</i></span> is given on the first line of the input file. Each 
test case takes one line containing a circular sequence that is written as an arbitrary linear sequence. Since the 
circular sequences are DNA sequences, only four symbols, <tt>A</tt>, <tt>C</tt>, <tt>G</tt> and <tt>T</tt>, are allowed. Each sequence has 
length at least 2 and at most 100.

Output</a>&nbsp;</font>

<p>
Print exactly one line for each test case. The line is to contain the lexicographically smallest sequence for the 
test case.

The following shows sample input and output for two test cases.
