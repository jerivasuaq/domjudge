<p>
The designers at Gazillion Games Inc. have come up with a new, 
relatively simple game called ``Stake Your Claim".  Two players - 0 and 1 - initially 
select two values <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> and <span class="MATH"><i>m</i></span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> and an 
<span class="MATH"><i>n</i>&#215;<i>n</i></span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> board is created with <span class="MATH"><i>m</i></span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> 0's 
and <span class="MATH"><i>m</i></span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> 1's randomly placed on the board.  Starting with player 0, each player puts his/her 
number in one of the empty squares on the board.  After the board is filled, 
each player's score is equal to the largest connected region on the board 
filled with that player's number (where a connected region is one where for 
any two squares in the region a path exists consisting of only N/S/E/W moves).  
The player with the highest score wins, and is
awarded the difference between his/her score and the score of the other 
player. Two examples of
finished games are shown below, with the largest connected regions for 
each player outlined.
Note in the second example that the two sections with 2 0's each are 
not connected.

<p>
In order to test how good this game is, the gang at Gazillion has hired 
you to write a program which can play the game.  Specifically, given any starting 
configuration, they would like a
program to determine the best move for the current player, i.e., the 
score which maximizes the points awarded to that player (or minimizes those awarded to the 
player's opponent).

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>
Input will consist of multiple test cases. Each test case will start 
with a line containing a positive integer <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> (<span class="MATH"><img width="18" height="31" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="3731img2.png" alt="$ \leq$"> 8</span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>) indicating the size of the 
board.  Next will come
<span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> lines describing the current board layout (row 0 first, followed by 
row 1, etc).  Each of
these lines will contain <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> characters taken from <tt>`0'</tt>, <tt>`1'</tt> 
and <tt>`.'</tt>, where <tt>`.'</tt>
represents an empty square.  The first character will be in column 0, 
the second in column 1, etc.  The number of 0's on the board will either be equal to the number 
of 1's or one greater, and there will be between 1 and 10 (inclusive) empty squares.
The last case is followed by a line containing 0 which indicates 
end-of-input and should not be processed.

Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>
For each test case, output a single line containing two items: the 
coordinates of the best move for the player and the best point total achieved by that 
player.  In case of ties, print the move which comes first lexicographically.  Use the format 
shown in the sample output.
