<p>IONU Satellite Imaging, Inc. records and stores very large images using run 
length encoding. You are to write a program that reads a compressed image, finds 
the edges in the image, as described below, and outputs another compressed image 
of the detected edges.<br>
<br>
A simple edge detection algorithm sets an output pixel's value to be the maximum 
absolute value of the differences between it and all its surrounding pixels in 
the input image. Consider the input image below:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="p2065_1.gif" width="295" height="273"><img border="0" src="p2065_2.gif" width="295" height="273"></p>
<p>The upper left pixel in the output image is the maximum of the values 
|15-15|, |15-100|, and |15-100|, which is 85. The pixel in the 4th row, 2nd 
column is computed as the maximum of |175-100|, |175-100|, |175-100|, |175-175|, 
|175-25|, |175-175|, |175-175|, and |175-25|, which is 150. </p>
<p>Images contain 2 to 1,000,000,000 (10<sup>9</sup>) pixels. All images are 
encoded using run length encoding (RLE). This is a sequence of pairs, containing 
pixel value (0-255) and run length (1-10<sup>9</sup>). Input images have at most 
1,000 of these pairs. Successive pairs have different pixel values. All lines in 
an image contain the same number of pixels.</p>

<p>Input consists of information for one or more images. Each image starts with 
the width, in pixels, of each image line. This is followed by the RLE pairs, one 
pair per line. A line with 0 0 indicates the end of the data for that image. An 
image width of 0 indicates there are no more images to process. The first image 
in the example input encodes the 5x7 input image above.<br>
<br>


<p><b><font color="#ff0000" size="4"><a name="SECTION0001003000000000000000">Output</a> 
</font></b></p>
Output is a series of edge-detected images, in the same format as the input 
images, except that there may be more than 1,000 RLE pairs.<br>
<br>
<b>Important Note</b>: A brute force solution that attempts to compute an output 
value for every individual pixel will likely fail due to space or time 
constraints.</p>
