<p>
A very small rural library has only one shelf dedicated to reserve books (reserve books are deemed important to
a large number of library users and can therefore be checked out only for very short periods of time) .

<p>
When the library's staff places a book on reserve, the book is put on the reserve shelf's left end. All books
that were already on the reserve shelf must therefore be moved to the right, just enough to make room for the new
book on the shelf. When a reserve book is checked out and subsequently returned, it is also put on the reserve shelf's
left end, as if it were just being placed on reserve. What happens when the shelf is full? When a book is placed on
reserve, or when a previously checked out reserve book is returned, and there is not enough room on the reserve
bookshelf, then, starting at the right end, as many books (but no more) are removed from the reserve shelf (they
are "taken off reserve") as needed in order to make room for the book to be put on the reserve bookshelf.

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
The first line of the input file contains a single integer, the total available space on the reserve book shelf
(when it is empty), measured in millimeters (1 inch equals about 25 millimeters). Its value will be at least 250
and at most 1500. Your program will start with an empty reserve book shelf.

<p>
Each subsequent line of input will start with one of the four commands ADD, CHECKOUT, RETURN, PRINT in upper case
letters, starting in column 1.
<blockquote>
<li>The ADD command is followed by a title (starting in column 10), consisting of at most 29 printable
characters. The title is followed (starting in column 40) by the thickness of the book (the amount of book shelf
space it will require), a positive integer, not greater than 150. The effect of the ADD command will be to place a
new title on reserve, as described above. Once a particular title has been ADDed, it will not be ADDed again as long
as that book is on the reserve book shelf or has been checked out. However, if a title has been forced off the reserve
book shelf (by another ADD command or by a RETURN command) then that title may appear in a subsequent ADD command
(with the same thickness as before).<br><br>
<li>The CHECKOUT command is followed by a title (starting in column 10) which is currently on the reserve
shelf. The effect of the CHECKOUT command is to remove the specified title from the reserve shelf (until it is placed
back on the reserve shelf by a subsequent RETURN command.<br><br>
<li>A CHECKOUT may create a gap between two books (for example, when "The C Programming Language"  is checked out in
the example shown). Such a gap will count as part of the free space.<br><br>
<li>The RETURN command is followed by a title (starting in column 10) which is currently checked out. The effect of the
RETURN command is to put the specified book to the left end of the reserve shelf, as described in the introductory
paragraphs.<br><br>
<li>The effect of the PRINT command will be to display in the output file: the title and thickness of each book currently
on the reserve shelf, one book per line, in the (left-to-right) order in which the books are currently on the reserve shelf,
the currently available space on the reserve shelf, and one blank line.
</li></li></li></li></li></blockquote>
<p>
There will not be any trailing blank spaces in the input  file.

Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

Pay attention to all formatting details, such as punctuation, upper/lower case characters, and the presence or
absence of blank spaces and blank lines. All titles, as well as the sentence "AVAILABLE SHELF SPACE:" are left-justified,
starting in column 1. All numerical quantities are displayed right-justified, with the unit's digit in column 34.
