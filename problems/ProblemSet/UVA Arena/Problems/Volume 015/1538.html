A polygonal number is a number which can be represented by a regular geometrical arrangement of
equally spaced points, where the arrangement forms a regular polygon. Some examples are shown in
the figure below.

The first figure shows the first 4 triangular numbers 1, 3, 6, 10. The next three show the first four
square, pentagonal and hexagonal numbers, respectively. In general, k-gonal numbers are those whose
points define a regular k-gon (hence triangular numbers are 3-gonal, square numbers are 4-gonal, etc.).
We will define k as an index of the polygonal number. For this problem, you are to find numbers which
are k-gonal for two or more values of k. We will call these numbers poly-polygonal.

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>
Input will consist of multiple problem instances. Each instance will consist of 3 lines. The first line
will be a non-negative integer n &le; 50 indicating the number of types of polygonal numbers of interest
in this problem. Note that this line may be longer than 80 characters. The next line will contain n
integers indicating the indices of these polygonal numbers (all distinct and in increasing order). For
example, if the first line contained the value 3, and the next line contained the values 3 610, then that
problem instance would be interested in 3-gonal, 6-gonal and 10-gonal numbers. Each index k will lie
in the range 3 &le; k &le; 1000. The last line of the problem instance will consist of a single positive integer
s &le; 10000, which serves as a starting point for the search for poly-polygonal numbers. A value of n = 0
terminates the input.

Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>
For each problem instance, you should output the next 5 poly-polygonal numbers which are greater
than or equal to s. Each number should be on a single line and conform to the following format:
<p>
<tt>num:k1 k2 k3 ...</tt>
<p>
where num is the poly-polygonal number, and k1, k2, k3 ... are the indices (in increasing order) of the
poly-polygonal number equal to num. A single space should separate each index, and you should separate
each problem instance with a single blank line. The judge's input will be such that the maximum value
for any poly-polygonal number will fit in a long variable.
