      <p>If you want to buy a&nbsp;new cellular phone, there are many various 
      types to choose from. To decide which one is the best for you, you have to 
      consider several important things: its size and weight, battery capacity, 
      WAP support, colour, price. One of the most important things is also the 
      list of games the phone provides. Nokia is one of the most successful 
      phone makers because of its famous Snake and Snake&nbsp;II. ACM wants to 
      make and sell its own phone and they need to program several games for it. 
      One of them is Master-Mind, the famous board logical game. 
      <p>The game is played between two players. One of them chooses 
      a&nbsp;<em>secret code</em> consisting of <var>P</var>&nbsp;ordered pins, 
      each of them having one of the predefined set of 
      <var>C</var>&nbsp;colours. The goal of the second player is to guess that 
      secret sequence of colours. Some colours may not appear in the code, some 
      colours may appear more than once. 
      <p>The player makes guesses, which are formed in the same way as the 
      secret code. After each guess, he/she is provided with an&nbsp;information 
      on how successful the guess was. This feedback is called 
      a&nbsp;<em>hint</em>. Each hint consists of <var>B</var> black points and 
      <var>W</var> white points. The black point stands for every pin that was 
      guessed right, i.e. the right colour was put on the right position. The 
      white point means right colour but on the wrong position. For example, if 
      the secret code is "white, yellow, red, blue, white" and the guess was 
      "white, red, white, white, blue", the hint would consist of one black 
      point (for the white on the first position) and three white points (for 
      the other white, red and blue colours). The goal is to guess the sequence 
      with the minimal number of hints. 
      <p>The new ACM phone should have the possibility to play both roles. It 
      can make the secret code and give hints, but it can also make its own 
      guesses. Your goal is to write a&nbsp;program for the latter case, that 
      means a&nbsp;program that makes Master-Mind guesses.

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

      <p>There is a&nbsp;single positive integer <var>T</var> on the first line 
      of input. It stands for the number of test cases to follow. Each test case 
      describes one game situation and you are to make a&nbsp;guess. On the 
      first line of each test case, there are three integer numbers, 
      <var>P</var>, <var>C</var> and <var>M</var>. <var>P</var> ( 1 &lt;= 
      <var>P</var> &lt;= 10) is the number of pins, <var>C</var> (1 &lt;= 
      <var>C</var> &lt;= 100) is the number of colours, and <var>M</var> (1 
      &lt;= <var>M</var> &lt;= 100) is the number of already played guesses. 
      <p>Then there are 2 <var>x M</var> lines, two lines for every guess. At 
      the first line of each guess, there are <var>P</var> integer numbers 
      representing colours of the guess. Each colour is represented by 
      a&nbsp;number <var>G</var><sub><var>i</var></sub>, 1 &lt;= 
      <var>G</var><sub><var>i</var></sub> &lt;= <var>C</var>. The second line 
      contains two integer numbers, <var>B</var> and <var>W</var>, stating for 
      the number of black and white points given by the corresponding hint. 
      <p>Let's have a&nbsp;secret code <var>S</var><sub>1</sub>, 
      <var>S</var><sub>2</sub>, ... <var>S</var><sub><var>P</var></sub> and the 
      guess <var>G</var><sub>1</sub>, <var>G</var><sub>2</sub>, ... 
      <var>G</var><sub><var>P</var></sub>. Then we can make a&nbsp;set 
      <var>H</var> containing pairs of numbers (<var>I</var>,<var>J</var>) such 
      that <var>S</var><sub><var>I</var></sub> = 
      <var>G</var><sub><var>J</var></sub>, and that any number can appear at 
      most once on the first position and at most once on the second position. 
      That means for every two different pairs from that set, 
      (<var>I</var><sub>1</sub>,<var>J</var><sub>1</sub>) and 
      (<var>I</var><sub>2</sub>,<var>J</var><sub>2</sub>), we have 
      <var>I</var><sub>1</sub> &lt;&gt; <var>I</var><sub>2</sub> and 
      <var>J</var><sub>1</sub> &lt;&gt; <var>J</var><sub>2</sub>. Then we denote 
      <var>B</var>(<var>H</var>) the number of pairs in the set, that meet the 
      condition <var>I</var> = <var>J</var>, and <var>W</var>(<var>H</var>) the 
      number of pairs with <var>I</var> &lt;&gt; <var>J</var>. 
      <p>We define an&nbsp;ordering of every two possible sets 
      <var>H</var><sub>1</sub> and <var>H</var><sub>2</sub>. Let's say 
      <var>H</var><sub>1</sub> &lt;= <var>H</var><sub>2</sub> if and only if one 
      of the following holds: 
      <ul>
        <li><var>B</var>(<var>H</var><sub>1</sub>) &lt; 
        <var>B</var>(<var>H</var><sub>2</sub>), or 
        <li><var>B</var>(<var>H</var><sub>1</sub>) = 
        <var>B</var>(<var>H</var><sub>2</sub>) and 
        <var>W</var>(<var>H</var><sub>1</sub>) &lt;= 
        <var>W</var>(<var>H</var><sub>2</sub>)</li></li></ul>
<p>Then we can find 
      a&nbsp;maximal set <var>H</var><sub><var>max</var></sub> according to this 
      ordering. The numbers <var>B</var>(<var>H</var><sub><var>max</var></sub>) 
      and <var>W</var>(<var>H</var><sub><var>max</var></sub>) are the black and 
      white points for that hint. </p>

Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

      <p>For every test case, print the line containing <var>P</var> numbers 
      representing <var>P</var> colours of the next guess. Your guess must be 
      valid according to all previous guesses and hints. The guess is valid if 
      the sequence could be a&nbsp;secret code, i.e. the sequence was not 
      eliminated by previous guesses and hints. 
      <p>If there is no valid guess possible, output the sentence <tt>You are 
      cheating!</tt>. If there are more valid guesses, output the one that is 
      lexicographically smallest. I.e. find such guess <var>G</var> that for 
      every other valid guess <var>V</var> there exists such a&nbsp;number 
      <var>I</var> that: 
      <ul>
        <li><var>G</var><sub><var>J</var></sub> = 
        <var>V</var><sub><var>J</var></sub> for every
