Once upon a time the following puzzle was suggested to pupils on a regional middle school olympiad on mathematics:

<p>

<ul>
<li>A set of coins consists of 15 coins: 14 coins are valid while a remaining 15-th coin is a false one. All valid coins have one and the same weight while the false coin has a different weight. One valid coin is marked. Is it possible to identify a false coin balancing coins 3 times at most?
</li>
</ul>

<p>
A jury  member was a trainer of a team of undergraduates   for programming contests. So a question on how to 
put the puzzle for programming arose naturally. Fin ally the problem was formulated as follows:

<p>

<ul>
<li>A set of coins consists of <span class="MATH"><i>N</i></span> coins: (<span class="MATH"><i>N</i> - 1</span>) coins are valid while a remaining <span class="MATH"><i>N</i></span>-th coin is a false one. All valid coins have one and the same weight while the false coin has a different weight. One valid coin is marked. 
Write a program which for every input pair

<ul>
<li>a number <span class="MATH"><i>N</i></span> of coins under question,  
</li>
<li>a limit <span class="MATH"><i>K</i></span> of balancing
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
outputs either ``<tt>POSSIBLE</tt>" or ``<tt>IMPOSSIBLE</tt>" with respect to existence of a 
strategy to identify the false coin balancing coins <span class="MATH"><i>K</i></span> times at most.
