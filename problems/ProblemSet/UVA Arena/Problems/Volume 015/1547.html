      <p>Building the GSM network is a&nbsp;very expensive and complex task. 
      Moreover, after the <em>Base Transceiver Stations</em> (<em>BTS</em>) are 
      built and working, we need to perform many various measurements to 
      determine the state of the network, and propose effective improvements to 
      be made. 
      <p>The ACM technicians have a&nbsp;special equipment for measuring the 
      strength of electro-magnetic fields, the transceivers' power and quality 
      of the signal. This equipment is packed into a&nbsp;huge knapsack and the 
      technician must move with it from one BTS to another. Unfortunately, the 
      knapsack have not enough memory for storing all of the measured values. It 
      has a&nbsp;small cache only, that can store values for several seconds. 
      Then the values must be transmitted to the BTS by an&nbsp;infrared 
      connection (IRDA). The IRDA needs direct visibility between the technician 
      and the BTS. 
      <p>Your task is to find the path between two neighbouring BTSes such that 
      at least one of those BTSes is always visible.

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

      <p>There is a&nbsp;single positive integer <var>T</var> on the first line 
      of input. It stands for the number of test cases to follow. Each test case 
      consists of a&nbsp;town description. For simplicity, a&nbsp;town is 
      modelled as a&nbsp;rectangular grid of <var>P x Q</var> square fields. 
      Each field is exactly 1&nbsp;metre wide. For each field, 
      a&nbsp;non-negative integer 
      <var>Z</var><sub><var>i</var>,<var>j</var></sub> is given, representing 
      the height of the terrain in that place, in metres. That means the town 
      model is made of cubes, each of them being either solid or empty. There 
      are no "half solid" cubes. 
      <p>The first line of each test case contains two integer numbers 
      <var>P</var> and <var>Q</var>, separated by a&nbsp;single space, 1 &lt;= 
      <var>P</var>,<var>Q</var> &lt;= 200. Then there are <var>P</var> lines 
      each containing <var>Q</var> integer numbers separated by a&nbsp;space. 
      These numbers are <var>Z</var><sub><var>i</var>,<var>j</var></sub>, where 
      1 &lt;= <var>i</var> &lt;= <var>P</var>, 1 &lt;= <var>j</var> &lt;= 
      <var>Q</var> and 0 &lt;= <var>Z</var><sub><var>i</var>,<var>j</var></sub> 
      &lt;= 5000. After the terrain description, there are four numbers 
      <var>R</var><sub>1</sub>, <var>C</var><sub>1</sub>, 
      <var>R</var><sub>2</sub>, <var>C</var><sub>2</sub> on the last line of 
      each test case. These numbers represent position of two BTSes, 1 &lt;= 
      <var>R</var><sub>1</sub>,<var>R</var><sub>2</sub> &lt;= <var>P</var>, 1 
      &lt;= <var>C</var><sub>1</sub>,<var>C</var><sub>2</sub> &lt;= 
      <var>Q</var>. The first coordinate (<var>R</var>) determines the row of 
      the town, the second coordinate determines the column. 
      <p>The technician is moving in steps (<em>steps</em> stands for 
      <em>Standard Technician's Elementary Positional Shift</em>). Each step is 
      made between two neighbouring square fields. That means the step is always 
      in North, South, West or East direction. It is not possible to move 
      diagonally. The step between two fields <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> 
      (step from <var>A</var> to <var>B</var>) is allowed only if the height of 
      the terrain in the field <var>B</var> is not very different from the 
      height in the field <var>A</var>. The technician can climb at most 
      1&nbsp;metre up or descend at most 3&nbsp;metres down in a&nbsp;single 
      step. 
      <p>At the end of each step, at least one of the two BTSes must be visible. 
      However, there can be some point "in the middle of the step" where no BTS 
      is visible. This is OK and the data is handled by the cache. The BTS is 
      considered visible, if there is a&nbsp;direct visibility between the unit 
      cube just above the terrain on the BTSes coordinates and the cube just 
      above the terrain on the square field, where the technician is. Direct 
      visibility between two cubes means that the line connecting the centres of 
      the two cubes does not intersect any solid cube. However, the line can 
      touch any number of solid cubes. In other words, consider both the BTS and 
      the technician being points exactly half metre above the surface and in 
      the centre of the appropriate square field. 
      <p>Note that the IRDA beam can go between two cubes that touch each other 
      by their edge, although there is no space between them. It is because such 
      a&nbsp;beam touches both of these two cubes but does not intersect any of 
      them. See the last test case of the sample input for an&nbsp;example of 
      such a&nbsp;situation.

</h2>

      <p>You are to find the shortest possible path meeting the above criteria. 
      All steps must be done between neighbouring fields, the terrain must not 
      elevate or descend too much, and at the end of each step, at least one BTS 
      must be visible. 
      <p>For each test case, print one line containing the sentence <tt>The 
      shortest path is </tt><var>M</var><tt> steps long.</tt>, where 
      <var>M</var> is the number of steps that must be made. If there is no such 
      path, output the sentence <tt>Mission impossible!</tt>.
