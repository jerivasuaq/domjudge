<p>
Your little sister got a new mechanical building kit, which includes many cog-wheels of different sizes.
She started building gears with different ratios, but soon she noticed that there were some ratios which
were quite difficult to realize, and some others she couldn’t realize at all. Since the most intelligent being
in your family is your computer (as you have always been claiming), now it has to figure out which ratios
are achievable.

<p>
There you are! That’s the punishment for bragging about your computer. Now, you must write a
program that will do the job: your sister tells you the sizes of the cog-wheels (the numbers of cogs they
have) in her kit. Then, she tells you the ratios of the gears she would like to build. Your computer has to
decide whether this is possible and, if so, determine how to connect the wheels to obtain the ratio.

<p>
Here is an example: let’s assume there are cog-wheels with 6, 12, and 30 cogs. Your sister wants to
realize a gear of ratio 4 : 5. One possible solution is the following:

<p align="center"><img src="p2185a.gif">

<p>
The picture shows a complete gear of ratio 4 : 5. Four wheels are used: c<sub>1</sub> with 12 cogs, d<sub>1</sub> with 6 cogs,
c<sub>2</sub> with 12 cogs, and d<sub>2</sub> with 30 cogs. Note that d<sub>1</sub> and c<sub>2</sub> share one axis. In this configuration, if c<sub>1</sub> turns
once, d<sub>2</sub> will make 4/5 of a rotation.

<p>
On the other hand, no gear of ratio 1 : 6 can be realized using the cog-wheels your sister has.

<p>The picture above can be written as 12 : 6; 12 : 30. Each transmission is written as c : d,wherecand d
denote the number of cogs of the two wheels. A list of transitions c<sub>1</sub> : d<sub>1</sub> , c<sub>2</sub> : d<sub>2</sub> , ... , c<sub>m</sub>:d<sub>m</sub> means that the
second wheel of each transition is on the same axis as the first one of the next transition (d<sub>i</sub> and c<sub>i+1</sub> share
one axis for 1 $le; i < m).="" for="" those="" of="" you="" who="" are="" not="" good="" at="" mechanics:="" the="" ratio="" realized="" by="" this="" gear="" is=""><p align="center"><img src="p2185b.gif">

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
<p>The input file contains the descriptions of several sets of cog-wheels, each one followed by a list of ratios
to be realized.

<p>A set of cog-wheels is described by one line starting with the number n of sizes of cog-wheels (1 &le;
n &le; 20). The rest of the line will consist of n numbers a<sub>1</sub>,...,a<sub>n</sub>, the numbers of cogs on the wheels. There
will always be at least 5 and at most 100 cogs per wheel. You may assume that your sister has an infinite
supply of wheels of each size.

<p>In your sister’s building kit (and thus, in the input file), the number of cogs on every wheel is divisible
by the number of cogs on the smallest wheel in the kit.

<p>The line describing the set of cog-wheels is followed by a list of ratios to be realized. Each ratio to
be realized is given by one line containing two numbers a<sub>j</sub> and b<sub>j</sub> (1 &le; aj , bj &le; 10000; a<sub>j</sub> != b<sub>j</sub> ), meaning
a<sub>j</sub> : b<sub>j</sub> . The line “0 0” marks the end of that list.

<p>At the end of the input file, there will be a line containing only a zero (instead of the number of cog-wheels
of the next set).

Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>Output one section for each set of cog-wheels. The sections should start with the line “Set #k” where k
is the number of the set.

<p>Then, output the results for the ratios from the test set. Output exactly one line for each ratio. Each
of these lines should start with “Ratio a<sub>j</sub> :b<sub>j</sub> :”, followed either by “Impossible” if the ratio cannot
be realized with the given set of cog-wheels, or a description of a gear which realizes the ratio. This
description has to be in the notation described above: a blank-separated list of transitions, each transition
having the form “c<sub>i</sub>:d<sub>i</sub>”.

<p>The gear does not need to be the smallest possible; we guarantee that if there is a solution then there is
a solution using at most 10000 transitions. Any solution with at most that many transitions is an acceptable
answer.

<p>Every section should be followed by a blank line.
