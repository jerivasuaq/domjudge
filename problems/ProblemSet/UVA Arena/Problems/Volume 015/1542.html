<p>When rendering a scene with multiple objects onto a screen, the order in 
which the objects are drawn is very important. In general, the farther an object 
is from the screen, the earlier it should be drawn allowing later, closer 
objects to be drawn on top of them. If two objects do not overlap, the order of 
drawing is immaterial. A binary space-partitioning (BSP) tree is one type of 
data structure which attempts to simplify the determination of the ordering of 
objects. It works as follows. Assume that the screen lies in the xy-plane 
centered on the z-axis and that the z-axis points away from the user looking at 
the screen. (For our purposes, assume the user lies near - &#8734;
on the z-axis.) We also assume that all the objects lie on the opposite side of 
the screen (z &gt; 0). The BSP tree is built by placing a series of planes parallel 
to the y-axis. The&nbsp; first plane divides space into two regions: a region 
containing the viewer and a region not containing the viewer. We partition all 
objects in space according to which of these two regions they lie in, and 
observe that all objects in the region containing the viewer should be drawn 
after all the objects in the other region. The BSP tree can be viewed at this 
point as a root with only two children, each child containing one of the 
partitions. We can now add a second plane, which subdivides the space again. We 
split each of the two partitions from the rst plane in two, making a total of 4 
partitions, and the resulting BSP tree now has three levels, with the partitions 
in the leaves (note that some of these partitions may contain several objects 
and some may contain none). This process is continued until each partition has 
at most one object in it, or until some predetermined number of planes has been 
used. The diagram below gives an example of using 1, 2 and 3 planes (looking 
down along the y-axis). For simplicity we assume that all objects lie parallel 
to the z-axis, so we need only deal this 2-d image to determine the BSP tree.</p>

<p align="LEFT">Assuming you have split the partitions correctly, a simple 
traversal of the BSP tree will give you an appropriate ordering for which to 
render the objects in the scene. Note in the example above that once a node 
contains just one object it need not be split as additional planes are added.</p>

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>


<p align="LEFT">Input will consist of several problem instances. The first line of each instance will 
contain a positive integer n &lt;= 20 indicating the number of objects in the 
scene. The next n lines will contain a description of these objects using the 
format m x1 z1 x2 z2 .. xm zm, where m is the number of vertices in the object 
and the remaining values are the vertices of the intersection of the object with 
the xz-plane. All objects will have between 3 and 6 vertices. Objects are 
assumed to be labeled &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, ... in the order they are defined. Next in 
the input le will be a positive integer p &lt;= 10 indicating the number of planes 
used to create the BSP tree. The last p input lines will contain a description 
of each plane of the form x1 z1 x2 z2 representing two points on the 
intersection line of the plane and the xz-plane. You may assume that no line 
will intersect any object (including edges and vertices) and that no plane is 
parallel to the z-axis. All coordinates will be integers.</p>

Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>


<p align="LEFT">Output will consist of a single line for each instamce containing the names of the 
objects in the order that they should be rendered for the specified BSP tree. In 
the case when some partition contains two or more objects, you should list the 
objects in alphabetical order.</p>
