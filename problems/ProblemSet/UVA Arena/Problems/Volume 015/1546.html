      <p>You probably know those quizzes in Sunday magazines: given the sequence 
      1, 2, 3, 4, 5, what is the next number? Sometimes it is very easy to 
      answer, sometimes it could be pretty hard. Because these "sequence 
      problems" are very popular, ACM wants to implement them into the "Free 
      Time" section of their new WAP portal. 
      <p>ACM programmers have noticed that some of the quizzes can be solved by 
      describing the sequence by polynomials. For example, the sequence 1, 2, 3, 
      4, 5 can be easily understood as a&nbsp;trivial polynomial. The next 
      number is 6. But even more complex sequences, like 1, 2, 4, 7, 11, can be 
      described by a&nbsp;polynomial. In this case, 
      1/2.<var>n</var><sup>2</sup>-1/2.<var>n</var>+1 can be used. Note that 
      even if the members of the sequence are integers, polynomial coefficients 
      may be any real numbers. 
      <p>Polynomial is an&nbsp;expression in the following form: <br>
      <p>
      <div align="center"><var>P</var>(<var>n</var>) = 
      <var>a</var><sub><var>D</var></sub>.<var>n</var><sup><var>D</var></sup>+<var>a</var><sub><var>D</var>-1</sub>.<var>n</var><sup><var>D</var>-1</sup>+...+<var>a</var><sub>1</sub>.<var>n</var>+<var>a</var><sub>0</sub> 
      </div>
<p><br clear="all">
      </p>
      <p>
<p>. If <var>a</var><sub><var>D</var></sub> &lt;&gt; 0, the number 
      <var>D</var> is called a&nbsp;<em>degree</em> of the polynomial. Note that 
      constant function <var>P</var>(<var>n</var>) = <var>C</var> can be 
      considered as polynomial of degree 0, and the zero function 
      <var>P</var>(<var>n</var>) = 0 is usually defined to have degree -1. </p>

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>

      <p>There is a&nbsp;single positive integer <var>T</var> on the first line 
      of input. It stands for the number of test cases to follow. Each test case 
      consists of two lines. First line of each test case contains two integer 
      numbers <var>S</var> and <var>C</var> separated by a&nbsp;single space, 1 
      &lt;= <var>S</var> &lt; 100, 1 &lt;= <var>C</var> &lt; 100, 
      (<var>S</var>+<var>C</var>) &lt;= 100. The first number, <var>S</var>, 
      stands for the length of the given sequence, the second number, 
      <var>C</var> is the amount of numbers you are to find to complete the 
      sequence. 
      <p>The second line of each test case contains <var>S</var> integer numbers 
      <var>X</var><sub>1</sub>, <var>X</var><sub>2</sub>, ... 
      <var>X</var><sub><var>S</var></sub> separated by a&nbsp;space. These 
      numbers form the given sequence. The sequence can always be described by 
      a&nbsp;polynomial <var>P</var>(<var>n</var>) such that for every 
      <var>i</var>, <var>X</var><sub><var>i</var></sub> = 
      <var>P</var>(<var>i</var>). Among these polynomials, we can find the 
      polynomial <var>P</var><sub><var>min</var></sub> with the lowest possible 
      degree. This polynomial should be used for completing the sequence.

Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
      <p>For every test case, your program must print a&nbsp;single line 
      containing <var>C</var> integer numbers, separated by a&nbsp;space. These 
      numbers are the values completing the sequence according to the polynomial 
      of the lowest possible degree. In other words, you are to print values 
      <var>P</var><sub><var>min</var></sub>(<var>S</var>+1), 
      <var>P</var><sub><var>min</var></sub>(<var>S</var>+2), .... 
      <var>P</var><sub><var>min</var></sub>(<var>S</var>+<var>C</var>). 
      <p>It is guaranteed that the results 
      <var>P</var><sub><var>min</var></sub>(<var>S</var>+<var>i</var>) will be 
      non-negative and will fit into the standard <em>integer</em> type.
