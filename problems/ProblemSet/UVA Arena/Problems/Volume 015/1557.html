Adam and Eve enter this year's ACM International Collegiate Programming
Contest. Last night, they played the Calendar Game, in celebration of
this contest. This game consists of the dates from January 1, 1900 to
November 4, 2001, the contest day. The game starts by randomly
choosing a date from this interval. Then, the players, Adam and Eve,
make moves in their turn with Adam moving first: Adam, Eve, Adam, Eve,
etc. There is only one rule for moves and it is simple: from a current
date, a player in his/her turn can move either to the next calendar
date or the same day of the next month. When the next month does not
have the same day, the player moves only to the next calendar date.
For example, from December 19, 1924, you can move either to December
20, 1924, the next calendar date, or January 19, 1925, the same day of
the next month. From January 31 2001, however, you can move only to
February 1, 2001, because February 31, 2001 is invalid.
</p>
<p> A player wins the game when he/she exactly reaches the date of
November 4, 2001. If a player moves to a date after November 4, 2001,
he/she looses the game.
</p>
<p>
Write a program that decides whether, given an
initial date, Adam, the first mover, has a winning strategy.

For this
game, you need to identify leap years, where February has 29 days. In
the Gregorian calendar, leap years occur in years exactly divisible by
four. So, 1993, 1994, and 1995 are not leap years, while 1992 and 1996
are leap years. Additionally, the years ending with 00 are leap years
only if they are divisible by 400. So, 1700, 1800, 1900, 2100, and
2200 are not leap years, while 1600, 2000, and 2400 are leap years.

</h2>
The input consists of <i>T</i>test cases. The number of test cases (<i>T</i>) is given in the first line of the input file. Each
test case is written in a line and corresponds to an initial date. The
three integers in a line, YYYY MM DD,
represent the date of the DD-th day of MM-th month in the year of YYYY.
Remember that initial dates are
randomly chosen from the interval between January 1, 1900 and November
4, 2001.

</h2>
Print exactly one line for each test case. The line should contain the
answer "YES" or "NO" to the question of
whether Adam has a winning strategy against Eve. Since we have <i>T</i> test
cases, your program should output
totally <i>T </i>lines of "YES" or "NO".
