<p>
Christiane and Matthias are playing a new game, the <em>Number Game</em>. The rules of the
Number Game are:

<p>
Christian and Matthias take turns in choosing integer numbers greater than or
equal to 2. The following rules restrict the set of numbers which may be chosen:

<p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>R1</strong></dt>
<dd>A number which has already been chosen by one of the players or a multiple of
  such a number cannot be chosen. (A number <span class="MATH"><i>z</i></span> is a <em>multiple</em> of a number <span class="MATH"><i>y</i></span> if <span class="MATH"><i>z</i></span>
  can be written as <span class="MATH"><i>y</i>·<i>x</i></span> and <span class="MATH"><i>x</i></span> is a positive integer.)

<p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>R2</strong></dt>
<dd>A sum of two such multiples cannot be chosen either.

<p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>R3</strong></dt>
<dd>For simplicity, a number which is greater than 20 cannot be chosen either. This
  enables a lot more NPCs (Non-Personal-Computers) to play this game.
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
The player who cannot choose any number anymore looses the Number Game.

<p>
Here is an example: Matthias starts by choosing 4. Then Christiane is not allowed to
choose 4, 8, 12,
etc. Let us assume her move is 3. Now, the numbers 3, 6, 9, etc. are excluded, too;
furthermore, numbers
like: 7 = 3 + 4, 10 = 2 <span class="MATH"><sup> . </sup></span> 3 + 4, 11 = 3 + 2 <span class="MATH"><sup> . </sup></span> 4, 13 = 3 <span class="MATH"><sup> . </sup></span> 3 + 4,
...are not available. So, in fact, the only
numbers left are 2 and 5. Matthias now says 2. Since 5 = 2 + 3 is now forbidden,
too, he wins because there is no number for Christiane's move left.

<p>
Your task is to write a program which will help to play the Number Game. In general,
i.e., without
rule <b>R3</b>, this game may go on forever. However, with rule <b>R3</b>, it is
possible to write a program that finds a strategy to win the game.

<p>


<p>
Given a game situation (a list of numbers which are not yet forbidden), your program
should output all
<em>winning moves</em>. A winning move is a move by which the player whose turn it is can
force a win no matter
what the other player will do. Now we define these terms more formally:

<p>

<ul>
<li>A <em>loosing position</em> is a position in which either

<ol>
<li>all numbers are forbidden, or
</li>
<li>no winning move exists.
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>A <em>winning position</em> is a position in which a winning move exists.
</li>
<li>A <em>winning move</em> is a move after which the position is a loosing position.
</li>
</ul>

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>
The first line contains the number of scenarios.

<p>
The input for each scenario describes a game position. It begins with a line containing
the number
<span class="MATH"><i>a</i></span>, 
<span class="MATH">0<img width="18" height="30" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="2336img1.gif" alt="$ \le$"><i>a</i> &lt; 20</span> of numbers which are still available. Next follows a single line
with the <span class="MATH"><i>a</i></span> numbers still available, separated by single blanks.

<p>
You may assume that all game positions in the input could really occur in the
Number Game (for
example, if 3 is not in the list of numbers available, 6 will not be, either).

Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>
The output for each scenario begins with a line containing `<tt>Scenario #<span class="MATH"><i>i</i></span>:</tt>',
where <span class="MATH"><i>i</i></span> is the number of
the scenario starting at 1. In the next line either print `<tt>There is no winning move.</tt>'
if this is true
for the position of the current scenario, or `<tt>The winning moves
are: 
<span class="MATH"><i>w</i><sub>1</sub>&nbsp;<i>w</i><sub>2</sub>&nbsp;...&nbsp;<i>w</i><sub>k</sub></span>.</tt>' where the
<span class="MATH"><i>w</i><sub>i</sub></span> are all the winning moves, in ascending order, separated by single blanks.
The output for each scenario should be followed by a blank line.
