      <p>ACM uses a&nbsp;new special technology of building its transceiver 
      stations. This technology is called <em>Modular Cuboid Architecture</em> 
      (<em>MCA</em>) and is covered by a&nbsp;patent of Lego company. All parts 
      of the transceiver are shipped in unit blocks that have the form of cubes 
      of exactly the same size. The cubes can be then connected to each other. 
      The MCA is modular architecture, that means we can select preferred 
      transceiver configuration and buy only those components we need. 
      <p>The cubes must be always connected "face-to-face", i.e. the whole side 
      of one cube is connected to the whole side of another cube. One cube can 
      be thus connected to at most six other units. The resulting equipment, 
      consisting of unit cubes is called <em>The Bulk</em> in the communication 
      technology slang. 
      <p>Sometimes, an&nbsp;old and unneeded bulk is condemned, put into 
      a&nbsp;storage place, and replaced with a&nbsp;new one. It was recently 
      found that ACM has many of such old bulks that just occupy space and are 
      no longer needed. The director has decided that all such bulks must be 
      disassembled to single pieces to save some space. Unfortunately, there is 
      no documentation for the old bulks and nobody knows the exact number of 
      pieces that form them. You are to write a&nbsp;computer program that takes 
      the bulk description and computes the number of unit cubes. 
      <p>Each bulk is described by its faces (sides). A&nbsp;special X-ray based 
      machine was constructed that is able to localise all faces of the bulk in 
      the space, even the inner faces, because the bulk can be partially hollow 
      (it can contain empty spaces inside). But any bulk must be connected (i.e. 
      it cannot drop into two pieces) and composed of whole unit cubes.

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
      <p>There is a&nbsp;single positive integer <var>T</var> on the first line 
      of input. It stands for the number of bulks to follow. Each bulk 
      description begins with a&nbsp;line containing single positive integer 
      <var>F</var>, 6 &lt;= <var>F</var> &lt;= 250, stating the number of faces. 
      Then there are <var>F</var> lines, each containing one face description. 
      All faces of the bulk are always listed, in any order. Any face may be 
      divided into several distinct parts and described like if it was more 
      faces. Faces do not overlap. Every face has one inner side and one outer 
      side. No side can be "partially inner and partially outer". 
      <p>Each face is described on a&nbsp;single line. The line begins with 
      an&nbsp;integer number <var>P</var> stating the number of points that 
      determine the face, 4 &lt;= <var>P</var> &lt;= 200. Then there are 3 
      <var>x P</var> numbers, coordinates of the points. Each point is described 
      by three coordinates <var>X</var>,<var>Y</var>,<var>Z</var> (0 &lt;= 
      <var>X</var>,<var>Y</var>,<var>Z</var> &lt;= 1000) separated by spaces. 
      The points are separated from each other and from the number <var>P</var> 
      by two space characters. These additional spaces were added to make the 
      input more human readable. The face can be constructed by connecting the 
      points in the specified order, plus connecting the last point with the 
      first one. 
      <p>The face is always composed of "unit squares", that means every edge 
      runs either in <var>X</var>, <var>Y</var> or <var>Z</var>-axis direction. 
      If we take any two neighbouring points 
      <var>X</var><sub>1</sub>,<var>Y</var><sub>1</sub>,<var>Z</var><sub>1</sub> 
      and 
      <var>X</var><sub>2</sub>,<var>Y</var><sub>2</sub>,<var>Z</var><sub>2</sub>, 
      then the points will always differ in exactly one of the three 
      coordinates. I.e. it is either <var>X</var><sub>1</sub> &lt;&gt; 
      <var>X</var><sub>2</sub>, or <var>Y</var><sub>1</sub> &lt;&gt; 
      <var>Y</var><sub>2</sub>, or <var>Z</var><sub>1</sub> &lt;&gt; 
      <var>Z</var><sub>2</sub>, other two coordinates are the same. Every face 
      lies in an&nbsp;orthogonal plane, i.e. exactly one coordinate is always 
      the same for all points of the face. The face outline will never touch nor 
      cross itself.
