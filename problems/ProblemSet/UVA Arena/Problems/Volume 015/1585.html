<p>
There is an objective test result such as ``<tt>OOXXOXXOOO</tt>". An `<tt>O</tt>' means a correct answer of a problem and an `<tt>X</tt>' means a wrong answer. The score of each problem of this test is calculated by itself and its just previous consecutive `<tt>O</tt>'s only when the answer is correct. For example, the score of the 10th problem is 3 that is obtained by itself and its two previous consecutive `<tt>O</tt>'s. 

<p>
Therefore, the score of ``<tt>OOXXOXXOOO</tt>" is 10 which is calculated by ``1+2+0+0+1+0+0+1+2+3". 

<p>
You are to write a program calculating the scores of test results.

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>
Your program is to read from standard input. The input consists of <span class="MATH"><i>T</i></span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> test cases. The number of test cases <span class="MATH"><i>T</i></span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> is given in the first line of the input. Each test case starts with a line containing a string composed by `<tt>O</tt>' and `<tt>X</tt>' and the length of the string is more than 0 and less than 80. There is no spaces between `<tt>O</tt>' and `<tt>X</tt>'.

Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>
Your program is to write to standard output. Print exactly one line for each test case. The line is to contain the score of the test case. 

<p>
The following shows sample input and output for five test cases.
