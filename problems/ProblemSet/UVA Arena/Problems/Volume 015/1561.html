Here is a game played on a cycle by two players. The rule of this game is as follows: At first, a cycle is given
  and each edge is assigned a non-negative integer. Among those integers, at least one is zero. Further a coin is
  put  on  a  vertex  of  the  cycle.  From  this  vertex,  the  game  starts  and  proceeds  with  two  players'
  alternating moves with the following series of choices:

<p>
<br>
 <table cols="2">
<col align="CENTER"><col align="LEFT">
<tr><td valign="BASELINE" align="CENTER" nowrap="">
 (1) </td><td valign="BASELINE" align="LEFT" nowrap=""> Choose an edge  incident with the vertex having the coin, </td></tr>
<tr><td valign="BASELINE" align="CENTER" nowrap=""> 
 (2) </td><td valign="BASELINE" align="LEFT" nowrap=""> Decrease the value of this edge to any non-negative integer strictly, </td></tr>
<tr><td valign="BASELINE" align="CENTER" nowrap=""> 
 (3) </td><td valign="BASELINE" align="LEFT" nowrap=""> Move the coin to the adjacent vertex along this edge.
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>

<p>
<br>
The game ends when a player on his turn cannot move because the value of each edge incident with the vertex
 having the coin is equal to zero. Then, that player is the loser.

Figure 1 illustrates an actual game. In this game, Alice is the first player and Bob is the second player.
 In the starting position in Figure 1 (a), Alice cannot but choose the right edge of the vertex having the coin.
 Alice then decreases its value from 2 to 0, and moves the coin along this edge, which makes (a) into (b). Next,
 Bob cannot but choose the down edge of the vertex having the coin; he then decreases its value from 5 to 1,
 which makes (b) into (c). In Figure 1 (c), Alice chooses the up edge of the vertex having the coin and decreases
 its value  from  1  to  0,  which  makes  (c)  into  (d).  Finally,  in  Figure  1  (d),  Bob  has  no  move
 since  each  edge incident with the vertex having the coin is assigned to zero. Then, Alice wins this game.

In fact, whenever the game starts as shown in Figure 1 (a), the first player can always win for any second
  player's move. In other words, in the starting position in Figure 1 (a), the first player has a winning strategy.

<p>
In this problem, you should determine whether or not the first player has a winning strategy from a given
 starting position.

<p>
The input consists of <span class="MATH"><i>T</i></span> test cases. The number of test cases <span class="MATH">(<i>T</i>)</span> is given on the first line of the
input file. Each test case starts with a line containing an integer  <span class="MATH"><i>N</i></span> 
<span class="MATH">(3<img width="18" height="30" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="2813img2.png" alt="$ \le$"><i>N</i><img width="18" height="30" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="2813img2.png" alt="$ \le$">20)</span> , where  <span class="MATH"><i>N</i></span> is
the number of vertices in a cycle. On the next line, there are the  <span class="MATH"><i>N</i></span> non-negative integers assigned to the
edges of the cycle. The  <span class="MATH"><i>N</i></span> integers  are  given  in  clockwise order starting  from  the vertex having  the
coin and  they  are  separated by  a single space. Note that at least one integer value among the  <span class="MATH"><i>N</i></span> integers
must be zero and that the value of no integer can be larger than 30.

<p>
Print exactly one line for each test case. The line is to contain `<tt>YES</tt>' if the first player has a
winning strategy from  the  starting  position.  Otherwise,  the  line  is  to  contain  `<tt>NO</tt>'.
