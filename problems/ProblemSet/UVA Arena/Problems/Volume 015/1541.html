<p align="LEFT">Alexander Charles McMillan loves to gamble, and during his last 
trip to the casino he ran across a new game. It is played on a linear sequence 
of squares as shown below.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="2104a.gif" width="364" height="86"></p>
<p align="LEFT">A chip is initially placed on the Start square. The player then 
tries to move the chip to the End square through a series of turns, at which 
point the game ends. In each turn a coin is flipped: if the coin is heads the 
chip is moved one square to the right and if the coin is tails the chip is moved 
two squares to the right (unless the chip is one square away from the End 
square, in which case it just moves to the End square). At that point, any 
instruction on the square the coin lands on must be followed. Each instruction 
is one of the following:</p>
<p align="LEFT">1. Move right n squares (where n is some positive integer)</p>
<p align="LEFT">2. Move left n squares (where n is some positive integer)</p>
<p align="LEFT">3. Lose a turn</p>
<p align="LEFT">4. No instruction</p>
<p align="LEFT">After following the instruction, the turn ends and a new one 
begins. Note that the chip only follows the instruction on the square it lands 
on after the coin ip. If, for example, the chip lands on a square that instructs 
it to move 3 spaces to the left, the move is made, but the instruction on the 
resulting square is ignored and the turn ends. Gambling for this game proceeds 
as follows: given a board layout and an integer T, you must wager whether or not 
you think the game will end within T turns. </p>
<p align="LEFT">After losing his shirt and several other articles of clothing, 
Alexander has decided he needs professional help-not in beating his gambling 
addiction, but in writing a program to help decide how to bet in this game.</p>

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p align="LEFT">Input will consist of multiple problem instances. The first line 
will consist of an integer n indicating the number of problem instances. Each 
instance will consist of two lines: the rst will contain two integers m and T (1 
&lt;= m &lt;= 50, 1 &lt;= T &lt;= 40), where m is the size of the board excluding the Start 
and End squares, and T is the target number of turns. The next line will contain 
instructions for each of the m interior squares on the board. Instructions for 
the squares will be separated by a single space, and a square instruction will 
be one of the following: +n, -n, L or 0 (the digit zero). The first indicates&nbsp; 
a right move of n squares, the second a left move of n squares, the third a 
lose-a-turn square, and the fourth indicates no instruction for the square. No 
right or left move will ever move you off the board.</p>

Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p align="LEFT">Output for each problem instance will consist of one line, 
either</p>
<p align="LEFT">Bet for. x.xxxx</p>
<p align="LEFT">if you think that there is a greater than 50% chance that the 
game will end in T or fewer turns, or</p>
<p align="LEFT">Bet against. x.xxxx</p>
<p align="LEFT">if you think there is a less than 50% chance that the game will 
end in T or fewer turns, or</p>
<p align="LEFT">Push. 0.5000</p>
<p align="LEFT">otherwise, where x.xxxx is the probability of the game ending in 
T or fewer turns rounded to 4 decimal places. (Note that due to rounding the 
calculated probability for display, a probability of 0.5000 may appear after the 
Bet for. or Bet against. message.)</p>
