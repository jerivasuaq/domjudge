A square pattern of light and dark cells is shown in its original
state and a transformed state. Write a program that will recognize the
minimum transformation that has been applied to the original pattern
given the following list of possible transformations:
<p>
<dl><dt><strong>90 Degree Rotation:</strong>
<dd> The pattern was rotated to the right 90 degrees.
  <dt><strong>180 Degree Rotation:</strong>
<dd> The pattern was rotated to the right 180 degrees.
  <dt><strong>270 Degree Rotation:</strong>
<dd> The pattern was rotated to the right 270 degrees.
  <dt><strong>Vertical Reflection:</strong>
<dd> The pattern was reflected through a
horizontal mirror positioned above the pattern.
  <dt><strong>Combination:</strong>
<dd> The pattern was subjected to a vertical
reflection <em>followed</em> by one of the rotations.
  <dt><strong>Preservation:</strong>
<dd> The original pattern was preserved (the new
pattern is identical to the original).
  <dt><strong>Improper:</strong>
<dd> The new pattern was not obtained via any of these treansformations.
<p>
 </dd></dt></dd></dt></dd></dt></dd></dt></dd></dt></dd></dt></dd></dt></dl><h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</a></font></h2>
<p>
The input file will consist of an unknown number of pattern datasets
on the standard input. Each pattern dataset will consist of an integer
on a line by itself, which gives the dimensions of the square
containing the pattern (the size will range from 1 to 10). The
following lines will contain each line of the original and new
(transformed) patterns in a side-by-side format, separated by a space.
Light squares will be indicated by a dot (period), while dark squares
will be represented with an <tt>X</tt>.
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</a></font></h2>
<p>
The output from your program will be a sentence describing the
relationship that the new pattern bears to the original.  Each
sentence will begin with a pattern ID number (starting with 1) and end
stating the relatinship representing the minimal amount of work
necessary to derive the new pattern from the original. For the purpose
of evaluating the amount of work needed, rotations are considered less
work than reflections, and smaller rotations are less work than larger
ones. Of course, ``preservation'' involves no work at all.
<p>
<p>
Note that only the above possibilities should be considered -- there
is no such thing as a ``360 degree rotation'' for this problem (such a
transformation would ``preserve'' the pattern), nor is there a
``horizontal reflection''. Also, remember that when a single rotation
or reflection is not sufficient, your program should next consider
rotated versions after a vertical reflection. Although a combination
transformation might yield the same new pattern as one of the single
transformations alone, the single transformation is the one you should
output (the minimal transformation).  Your output should be a complete
sentence, ending with a period.

Look at the sample output below for the exact format.
