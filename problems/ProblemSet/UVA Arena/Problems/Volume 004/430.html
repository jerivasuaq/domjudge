<p>
The smell of rebellion is rising over Swamp County. The county is 
geographically split into various bogs, each represented by a supervisor on the
Board of Supervisors.  Since the bogs have varying populations, each supervisor
has votes in proportion to the total population of the county, with a majority
of the total votes needed for an ordinance to pass. The smaller bogs
feel that they have no say on the Board because, in fact, the votes
of the largest bogs completely determine the outcome of a vote.
The smaller bogs might as well have zero votes.
<p>
<p>
Your team's job is to write some software to aid in finding a fairer 
voting plan.  The Board has agreed to consider a charter amendment that
would make the number of votes
needed to pass an ordinance a total other than that needed for a simple
majority.  Given the number of votes each bog holds, and the number of votes
necessary to win (which could be more or less than a majority of
the total votes), your program is to calculate the Banzhaf power index for
each bog.
<p>
Given the set of all possible votes, the Banzhaf power index for a bog
is the number of times it could change the outcome of the vote on an
ordinance from failure to passage.

<p>
Input to your program consists of a series of lines of at most 80 characters.
Each line consists of a series of numbers separated from each other by at
least one space.  The first number in a line is the minimum number of votes
needed for passage of an ordinance.  The rest of the numbers are the votes
held by each bog.
(For example, in the first line of the sample input below, the number of 
votes needed to pass an ordinance is 17.  There are six bogs, with votes of
1, 7, 3, 12, 9, and 1 respectively.)

<p>
For each case represented by an input line, your program is to
print the power index of each bog.
<p>
Output for each case should appear on a separate line, starting
in the first column, with each power index separated from the others by
single spaces.  The order of the power indexes on each line must correspond
to the input order of the votes for each bog.
<p>
<p>
Swamp County will never be divided into more than 27 bogs-there's a limit to
the number of lunches the lobbyists will buy.
