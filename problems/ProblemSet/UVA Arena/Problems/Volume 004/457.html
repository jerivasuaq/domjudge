A biologist is experimenting with DNA modification of
bacterial colonies being grown in a linear array of culture dishes. By
changing the DNA, he is able ``program&quot; the bacteria to respond to the
population density of the neighboring dishes. Population is measured
on a four point scale (from 0 to 3). The DNA information is
represented as an array <em>DNA</em>, indexed from 0 to 9, of population density
values and is interpreted as follows:
<p>
<ul><li>   In any given culture dish, let <i>K</i> be the sum of that culture dish's
   density and the densities of the dish immediately to the left and
   the dish immediately to the right. Then, by the next day, that dish
   will have a population density of <em>DNA[K]</em>.<li>   The dish at the far left of the line is considered to have a left
   neighbor with population density 0.<li>   The dish at the far right of the line is considered to have a right
   neighbor with population density 0.
<p>
</li></li></li></ul>
<p>
Now, clearly, some DNA programs cause all the bacteria to die off
(e.g., [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]). Others result in immediate population
explosions (e.g., [3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]).  The biologist is interested
in how some of the less obvious intermediate DNA programs might
behave.
<p>
<p>
Write a program to simulate the culture growth in a line of 40 dishes,
assuming that dish 20 starts with a population density of 1 and all
other dishes start with a population density of 0.

<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</a></font></h2>
<p>
The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself
indicating the number of the cases following, each of them as described below.
This line is followed by a blank line, and there is also a blank line between
two consecutive inputs.
<p>
For each input set your program will read in the DNA program (10 integer values) on one line.
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</a></font></h2>
<p>For each test case, the output must follow the description below. The outputs
of two consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.</p>
<p>
For each input set it should print the densities of the 40 dishes for each of the next 50
days. Each day's printout should occupy one line of 40 characters.
Each dish is represented by a single character on that line. Zero population
densities are to be printed as the character ` '. Population density 1
will be printed as the character `<tt>.</tt>'. Population density 2 will be
printed as the character `<tt>x</tt>'. Population density 3 will be printed as
the character `<tt>W</tt>'.

<b>Note:</b> Whe show only the first ten lines of output (the total number of lines must be 50) and the spaces have been replaced with the character <tt>&quot;b&quot;</tt> for ease of reading.
The actual output file will use the ASCII-space character, not <tt>&quot;b&quot;</tt>.
