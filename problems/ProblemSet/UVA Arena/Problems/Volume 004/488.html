<p>
In this problem you are to generate a triangular wave form according to a specified pair of
Amplitude and Frequency.
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input and Output</a></font></h2>
<p>
The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating
the number of the cases following, each of them as described below. This line is
followed by a blank line, and there is also a blank line between two consecutive
inputs.
<p>
Each input set will contain two integers, each on a separate line. The first integer is the Amplitude; the
second integer is the Frequency.
<p>
For each test case, the output must follow the description below. The outputs of
two consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.
<p>
For the output of your program, you will be printing wave forms each separated by a blank line.
The total number of wave forms equals the Frequency, and the horizontal ``height'' of each wave
equals the Amplitude. The Amplitude will never be greater than nine.
<p>
The waveform itself should be filled with integers on each line which indicate the ``height'' of that
line.
<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> There is a blank line after each separate waveform, <b>excluding</b> the last one.
