<p>
To help model the three dimensional volumes that describe each supercomputer
choice over
time, Valentine McKee and Jake Briggs decided to construct some cardboard
mock-ups. Valentine began by cutting out polygons of each of the
supercomputer criteria for each year. As she
was bringing the cut-outs to Jake's lab, where they intended to turn
the flat polygons into the
actual volumes, Valentine bumped into Ren McCormack. Literally.
And she dropped all of her polygon cut-outs onto the ground.
<p>
``Ren! Why don't you look where you're going,'' Valentine sighed. ``I
dropped all of my
polygons. Now I'm going to have to start all over cutting these out.''
Valentine had labeled the
polygons prior to cutting them out, but unfortunately, the labeling was
not part of the actual
polygon and was lost when they were cut out. ``I don't know which is
which now.''
<p>
``Sorry.'' Ren looked downcast, then brightened. ``Hey, do you want to
go to the dance with me this weekend?''
<p>
``I don't think so, Ren,'' replied Valentine, ``I think I'll be cutting out
and sorting polygons all
weekend.'' Valentine stooped and began picking up the cut-outs. Ren
was a great dancer but
he also tended to show it off. The one time that Valentine had gone to
a dance with him, Ren
had completely embarrassed her with his antics.
<p>
``Can't you use a computer or something to help you sort those things out?''
Ren picked up
one of the polygons and squinted at it. (Ren was a theater major.)
<p>
Valentine thought for a moment. ``Nope,'' she said. ``I'm just going to have
to start over. Have
fun at the dance this weekend, though.'' To herself, she thought, ``Yes, I
can use a computer.
The only other thing I need is that camera that Jake already has in the lab
to help me see the Big Picture.''

<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</a></font></h2>
<p>
The first line of input will consist of two integers separated by a space.
The first integer specifies
the number of polygons to be sorted. The second integer specifies the number
of vertices for each polygon.
<p>
<p>
The rest of the input will consist of two lists of coordinates. The first is
a list of coordinates
describing the shape of each polygon in terms of the values on each of
its axes (i.e., the values
for <tt>r1</tt> through <tt>r6</tt> in the figure below).
<p>

<p>
The vertices of each polygon are distributed at equal angles around the
origin, with the first
vertex aligned at 12 o'clock. The vertices are given in clockwise order.
The polygons in this list
are unique with respect to rotation and dilation. That is, no polygon will
be exactly like any
other polygon (having the same vertices in the same locations), nor can any
polygon be rotated
about its center and/or uniformly scaled such that it will be exactly
like another polygon in the list.
<p>
<p>
The second list of polygon coordinates corresponds to the polygons in
the first list, but as
measured by a camera. The vertices of each polygon in this case will be
given as (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>) pairs
with respect to the camera's viewpoint origin and are given in clockwise
order. The first vertex given is arbitrary, however.
<p>

<p>
Note that the camera's view of each polygon may include magnification or
de-magnification
(which may be different for each viewed polygon). Moreover, the camera
can only resolve the
polygon vertices to within plus or minus one pixel in its field of view,
so there may be some
jitter associated with the viewed vertex locations. For each polygon, the
maximum amount of
jitter at each vertex is guaranteed to be less than one percent of the
distance from the origin to the vertex farthest away from the origin.
<p>
<p>
All of the polygons viewed by the camera will be right-side up.

<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</a></font></h2>
<p>
The output is a list of instructions indicating how to rearrange the
scrambled polygons. That
is, for each polygon in the second list, the output should indicate the
polygon to which it
corresponds in the first list, the amount by which it must be rotated
in a clockwise direction to
align the vertices. Thus, one line of output consists of an integer
index <i>i</i> (indexing starts from
1), a floating point angle  (with ) given to
the nearest tenth of a degree.
