Surely you have made the experience that when too many people use the Internet simultaneously,
the net becomes very, very slow.
<p>
<p>
To put an end to this problem, the University of Ulm has developed a contingency scheme for times
of peak load to cut off net access for some cities of the country in a systematic, totally fair manner.
Germany's cities were enumerated randomly from 1 to <i>n</i>. Freiburg was number 1, Ulm was number
2, Karlsruhe was number 3, and so on in a purely random order.
<p>
<p>
Then a number <i>m</i> would be picked at random, and Internet access would first be cut off in city 1
(clearly the fairest starting point) and then in every <i>m</i>th city after that, wrapping around to 1 after <i>n</i>,
and ignoring cities already cut off. For example, if <i>n</i>=17 and <i>m</i>=5, net access would be cut off to the
cities in the order [1,6,11,16,5,12,2,9,17,10,4,15,14,3,8,13,7]. The problem is that it is clearly
fairest to cut off Ulm last (after all, this is where the best programmers come from), so for a given
n, the random number m needs to be carefully chosen so that city 2 is the last city selected.
<p>
<p>
Your job is to write a program that will read in a number of cities <i>n</i> and then determine the smallest integer <i>m</i> that will ensure that Ulm can surf the net while the rest of the country is cut off.

<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input Specification</a></font></h2>
<p>
The input file will contain one or more lines, each line containing one integer <i>n</i> with  <img width="90" height="25" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline43" src="440img1.gif"> , representing the number of cities in the country.
<p>
Input is terminated by a value of zero (0) for <i>n</i>.

<p>
For each line of the input, print one line containing the integer <i>m</i> fulfilling the requirement specified above.
