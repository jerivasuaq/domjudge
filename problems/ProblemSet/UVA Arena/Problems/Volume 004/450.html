<p>
The Public Relations Office is looking for an easier way to
compile the information for their Black Book, a listing of all
faculty members.  Currently, each department types up a list of
their faculty and submits the list to PR.  PR then takes all the
lists and makes a combined list that is sorted alphabetically by
last name.  So far they have been doing this task by hand, which
takes far more time than the average PR employee has to spare!
<p>
<p>
What PR is looking for is a program that will take these faculty
listings and combine them in a certain format that PR can use for
inclusion in the Black Book.  All the lists are stored in text
files.  Each department's file is sorted by last name.  The
program should take these individually sorted files and combine
them into a single sorted file in the format shown below.
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</a></font></h2>
<p>
The input file will contain, on the first line, a
number (between 2 and 12) that reports the number of departments that
your program should sort and write to the output file.
Following the first line will be a series of sets of lines. The first line of each set contains a department title, and following lines contain the data to be sorted.
<p>
The information
reported is in this order: Title, First Name, Last Name, Street
Address, Home Phone, Work Phone, and Campus Mailbox. The information is delimited with commas.
<p>
A blank line separates two sets of lines. There are the same number of  department titles and sets of data as the number on the first line reports.
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</a></font></h2>
<p>
The format of each record held in the output file should be
as follows:
<p>
<p>
<tt>--------------------</tt>
<p>
<tt>&lt;</tt>Title<tt>&gt;</tt> <tt>&lt;</tt>FirstName<tt>&gt;</tt> <tt>&lt;</tt>LastName<tt>&gt;</tt>
<p>
<tt>&lt;</tt>HomeAddress<tt>&gt;</tt>
<p>
<tt>Department: &lt;</tt>Department<tt>&gt;</tt>
<p>
<tt>Home Phone: &lt;</tt>HomePhone<tt>&gt;</tt>
<p>
<tt>Work Phone: &lt;</tt>WorkPhone<tt>&gt;</tt>
<p>
<tt>Campus Box: &lt;</tt>CampusBox<tt>&gt;</tt>
<p>
<p>
The dashed line should be shown at the top of each record.  The
characters &quot;<tt>&lt;</tt>&quot; and &quot;<tt>&gt;</tt>&quot; show where a field should be placed.
Please pay attention to spacing.
<p>
You may assume that all input files will be in the proper syntax,
with no extra spaces.  PR therefore expects that the data they
are requesting will be in the proper syntax.
