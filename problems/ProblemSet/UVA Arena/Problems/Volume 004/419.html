``Argh! I can't stand it anymore!'' exclaimed Dan Hanson, CS Department
administrative assistant, as he slammed down the phone.
<p>
``What's the matter, Dan?'' asked Valentine McKee, who happened to be in
the office making some copies.
<p>
``Professors and scheduling. I'm trying to schedule this SSC meeting but as
soon as I pick a
time and start making calls to confirm it, one of the committee members has
a conflict. I feel like this is going to go on forever!'' He Said.
<p>
``Maybe the computer can help,'' suggested Valentine. ``This is the computer
science department, after all,'' she Said.

<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</a></font></h2>
<p>
The first line of input will be the ``current'' date.
<p>
<p>
All dates will be specified in the form: <tt>dayname month date</tt>, where:
<p>
<ul><li> <tt>dayname</tt> is single character from the set <tt>{ M, T, W, R, F }</tt>
representing Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, respectively.<li> <tt>month</tt> is an integer such that  <img width="24" height="25" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline43" src="419img1.gif">  <tt>month</tt>  <img width="35" height="25" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline45" src="419img2.gif"> .<li> <tt>date</tt> is an integer such that  <img width="24" height="25" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline43" src="419img1.gif">  <tt>date</tt>  <img width="34" height="25" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline49" src="419img3.gif"> .
</li></li></li></ul>
<p>
The next line of input will contain two integers, <i>n</i> and <i>t</i>. <i>n</i> specifies
how many meetings
should be scheduled, while <i>t</i> indicates how long each meeting will last.
<i>t</i> will be specified in increments of 15 minutes.
<p>
<p>
All times will be specified as zero padded 4 digit integers in military time.
The first two
digits indicate the <tt>hour</tt> (00 corresponds to midnight). The appointment
times in the input will
be in the range of  <img width="33" height="25" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline61" src="419img4.gif">  <tt>hour</tt>  <img width="34" height="25" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline63" src="419img5.gif"> . The last two digits indicate
the minute, and will be in the
be from the set <tt>{ 00, 15, 30, 45 }</tt> .
<p>
<p>
You may assume that <tt>date</tt>, while formally bounded by 31, will not be
greater than the
number of days in the <tt>month</tt>. You may also assume that all years
will <em>not</em> be leap years.
<p>
<p>
The rest of the input will contain the schedules for at most 100 individuals.
Each schedule
will begin with a line specifying the individual's name, followed by a list
of appointments for
that individual, ending with the word ``<tt>done</tt>'' on a line by itself.
No individual will have more
than 100 appointments scheduled. Each appointment will be a date followed by
a start time
and an end time. No appointment will extend before 9am or after 5pm.
<p>
<p>
The last line of input will be the word ``<tt>done</tt>'' on a line by itself.
<p>
<p>
No appointment will be before the current date, or more than 1 year after
the current date.
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</a></font></h2>
<p>
Your program should output the first <i>n</i> possible meeting times when all the
people from the
input can meet for the specified amount of time (<i>t</i>). Each line of output
should contain one
meeting date and time. Once a common meeting time is found, it should be
considered allocated
for all people, and cannot be used to schedule other meetings.
<p>
<p>
The meetings should be sorted by date and time, with the earliest meeting first.
<p>
<p>
If less than <i>n</i> meeting times are available, print all possible meeting
times followed by ``<tt>No more times available</tt>''.
