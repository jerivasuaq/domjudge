<p>
The <i>quality</i> of pseudo random-number generators used in some computations,
especially simulation, is a
significant issue. Proposed generation algorithms are subjected to many
tests to establish their quality, or,
more usually, their lack of it. One of the common tests is the <i>run test</i>.
<p>
In this test, sequences are tested for ``runs up&quot; and ``runs down.&quot;
<p>
We will examine series of data values for the ``Up&quot; and ``Down&quot; sequences
each series contains.
<p>
<p>
Within a series, an ``Up&quot; sequence continues as long as each data-value
received is not less than the previous data-value.
An ``Up&quot; sequence terminates when a data-value received is less than the
previous data-value received.
<p>
A ``Down&quot; sequence continues as long as each data-value received is not greater
than the previous data-value. A ``Down&quot; sequence terminates when a
data-value received is greater than the previous data-value received.
<p>
<p>
An ``Up&quot; sequence can be initiated by the termination of a ``Down&quot; sequence
and vice versa. (Sequences
initiated in this manner have length one at this initiation point.)
<p>
<p>
All the initial data-values are part of an ``Up&quot; sequence, and contribute
to its length, if the first deviation of the data-values is upwards.
<p>
All the initial data-values are part of a ``Down&quot; sequence, and contribute
to its length, if the first deviation of the data-values is downwards.
<p>
<p>
If the data-values received don't allow classification as either an ``Up&quot;
or a ``Down&quot; sequence, the data should be considered to have neither sequence.
<p>
<p>
Find the average length of both the ``Up&quot; and the ``Down&quot; sequences
encountered for each input line in the
data file. Report these average lengths as each input line is processed.
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</a></font></h2>
<p>
Each of the separate series to be examined is contained on a single line
of input.
<p>
<p>
Each series to be analyzed consists of at least one and no more than
30 unsigned, non-zero integers. Each
integer in a series has at least one digit and no more than four digits.
The integers are separated from each
other by a single blank character. Each of the series will be terminated
by a single zero (0) digit. This terminator should not be
considered as being part of the series being analyzed.
<p>
<p>
The <i>set</i> of series to be analyzed is terminated by a single zero (0)
digit as the input on a line. This terminator should not
be considered to be a series, and no output should be produced in response
to its encounter.
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</a></font></h2>
<p>
A line with two real values is to be emitted for each input data set
encountered. It must begin with the message ``<tt>Nr values = <i>N</i>:  </tt>&quot;, where <i>N</i> is the number of input data in the line; and then to continue with the average values for runs.
<p>
First, the average ``Up&quot; run
length, then the average ``Down&quot; run length. Separate these values with
a space.
<p>
Answers must be rounded to six digits after the decimal point.
