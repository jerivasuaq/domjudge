<p>
An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of
another word or phrase.  For example, ``<tt>carthorse</tt>&quot; is an anagram of ``<tt>orchestra</tt>&quot;.  Blanks within a phrase are ignored in forming anagrams.  Thus, ``<tt>orchestra</tt>&quot; and ``<tt>horse cart</tt>&quot; are also anagrams.
<p>
<p>
   Write a program that reads a list of phrases and prints all pairs of anagrams occurring in the list.
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</a></font></h2>
<p>
The input file will contain a single integer at the first line of the input,
indicate the number of test case you need to test followed by a blank line. Each test case will consist of from 1 to 100 lines.  A completely empty or
     blank line signals the end of a test case. Each line constitutes one phrase.
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</a></font></h2>
<p>
Some number of lines (including possibly 0 if there are no anagrams in the list), each line containing two anagrammatic phrases
     separated by `<tt>=</tt>'.
<p>
<p>
Each anagram pair should be printed exactly once, and the order of
the two phrases within a printed pair must be lexicographic, as well as the first phrases and the second ones in case some first are equal.
<p>
Two consecutive output for two consecutive input is separated by a single blank
line.
