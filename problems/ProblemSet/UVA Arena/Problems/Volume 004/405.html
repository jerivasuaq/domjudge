<p>
The International Standards Organization has defined a Message Handling 
System (MHS) called <tt>X.400</tt>.  One of the functional units of a MHS, the 
MTA, handles routing of messages.  Routing is performed based on 
components of the Originator/Recipient name.  For the purposes of this 
problem, valid components of an O/R name (in order of widest scope to 
narrowest scope) are Country (C), Administrative Management Domain 
(ADMD), Private Management Domain (PRMD), and Organization Name (O).  
Each MTA uses its own routing table to forward messages on to the next 
MTA or delivering the message locally.
<p>
<p>
Your program is to simulate a collection of MTAs processing messages.  
Each time a message arrives (or is submitted) to an MTA, the MTA uses 
the O/R name of the message and the MTA's routing table to forward the 
message on to the appropriate MTA.  If the MTA finds that the message's 
final destination is itself, it will deliver the message locally.  Your 
program is to simulate this message-forwarding activity to trace the 
path of mail through the set of MTAs.
<p>
<p>
The routing function is accomplished by comparing the supplied fields 
of entries in the routing table against the O/R name components of the 
message.  Each routing table entry refers to exactly one MTA although  
MTAs may have multiple entries in the routing table.  The first routing 
table entry (starting from the top) whose fields match the 
corresponding O/R name components in the message is selected and the 
message is forwarded to that MTA.  It is possible for routing table 
entries to contain a wildcard (denoted by an asterisk); wildcard 
components always match the contents of the corresponding O/R name 
component in the message.
<p>
<p>
MTAs are also responsible for routing error detection and recovery.  If 
an MTA detects that it has received a message that it has handled 
before (a circular routing path is detected), it will place the message 
in the undeliverable queue and generate a non-delivery report.  In 
addition, if an MTA is unable to route a message (ie no routing table 
entry match the message's O/R name), it will place the message in the 
undeliverable queue and generate a routing error report.
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</a></font></h2>
<p>
Input to your program will consist of a series of message routing 
scenarios.  Input for each scenario starts with a single line that 
contains a single integer ( <img width="90" height="26" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline28" src="405img1.gif"> ) indicating the number of MTAs
in the scenario.  Subsequent lines will contain a description for each 
of the <i>M</i> MTAs.
<p>
<p>
Each MTA description starts with a line containing the name of the MTA 
(a left justified alphabetic string of 1 to 10 characters with no 
embedded spaces) in columns 1-10 and an integer ( <img width="71" height="26" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline32" src="405img2.gif"> ) in column
12 indicating the number of entries in the MTA's routing table.  Each 
of the following <i>I</i> lines will then contain a valid name of an adjacent 
MTA in columns 1-10 followed by the Country, ADMD, PRMD, and 
Organization Name in columns 15-24, 30-39, 45-54, and 60-69 
respectively.  Each O/R name component will consist of 1 to 10 
alphabetic characters left-justified in their field with no embedded 
blanks.  Alternatively, an O/R name component may contain a single 
asterisk (<tt>*</tt>) in the first column in the field indicating a wild-card 
match in the field.
<p>
<p>
Following the description of the MTAs, there will be a single line 
containg a single integer (0&lt;<i>N</i>&lt;32768) indicating the number of messages
to be sent in the simulation.  Each of the subsequent <i>N</i> lines will 
contain the description of exactly one message.  Each message 
description contains a valid name of one of the MTAs described above 
left-justified in columns 1-10 followed by the Country, ADMD, PRMD, and 
Organization Name in columns 15-24, 30-39, 45-54, and 60-69 
respectively.  Each O/R name component will consist of 1 to 10 
alphabetic characters left-justified in their field with no embedded 
blanks and the MTA name is where the message is submitted and the 
simulation begins.
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</a></font></h2>
<p>
For each scenario, you are to print ``<tt>Scenario # X</tt>&quot; where <i>X</i> is the
number of the scenario starting with 1 and incrementing for subsequent 
scenarios.  Each of the following <i>N</i> lines will contain the number of 
the message left-justified in column 1 
immediately followed by one of the following messages:
<p>
<p>
``<code> -- delivered to MTA_NAME</code>&quot;,
``<code> -- circular routing detected by MTA_NAME</code>&quot;, or
<p>
``<code> -- unable to route at MTA_NAME</code>&quot;.
<p>
<p>
In all three messages, <code>MTA_NAME</code> is replaced by the name of the MTA
generating the report.  Other than <code>MTA_NAME</code>, you are to print the
string exactly as above including spacing and dashes. After the list of message reports, you are to print a single blank line 
and continue processing with the next scenario.
