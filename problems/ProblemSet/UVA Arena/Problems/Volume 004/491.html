<p>
Your boss is re-tiling his bathroom and wishes to know how many unique ways there are to
arrange an arbitrary number of tiles on the wall. He has assigned you to figure this out, but won't
tell you how many tiles he has.
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input and Output</a></font></h2>
<p>
Design a program that accepts the number of tiles and returns the
number of unique different arrangements. An arrangement is unique if it cannot be rotated in two dimensions to match any other arrangement.
<p>
<p>
For example, if there were 3 tiles, there are 2 possible arrangements:
<p>

<p>
Note that the following arrangement does not count because it can be rotated on a plane into one of the previous shapes:
<p>
<center><img src="491img2.gif"></center>
<p>
Also note that the following two arrangements are different because they cannot be rotated into
the same shape:
<p>
<center><img src="491img3.gif"></center>
