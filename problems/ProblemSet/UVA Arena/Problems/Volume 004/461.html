Write a program that will assist the receptionist in seating customer
parties at tables and booths in a large restaurant.   Your program
should accept for the receptionist the arrival time, the size of the
party, whether the party desires a table or a booth, in the smoking
or nonsmoking sections of the restaurant.
<p>
<p>
For each request in a list
of requests, the program should provide a table number and the
approximate waiting time before the party can be seated.  The
restaurant has the following seating characteristics:

<p>
Each table of the table groups is portable and can be moved such that as
many as five tables of any group may be connected to seat a larger party
than any one table could seat.  This connection of tables is only possible
if the sequential number of the tables to be used are vacant.  Thus 2
four-person tables can be joined together to seat a party of 6; 3
four-person table can be joined to seat a party of 8, and so on.
<p>
Parties of 1 take 35 minutes, parties of 2 take 47 minutes at the
restaurant (service is very predictable), parties of 3 or 4 take 52 minutes,
while parties of 5 to 10 take 55 minutes.  Parties of greater than 10 take

<p>
<p>
Your program should always assign the lowest booth/table number available.
You should also process the requests in the order given and once an
assignment is made, not change it.

<p>
Your program should accept a sequence of reservation requests (the
restaurant requires reservations).  Each reservation consists of one line
with an integer arrival time (in minutes past 8:00 p.m.), the party size
(at least 1), a blank, then an `<tt>S</tt>' or an `<tt>N</tt>' (smoking or nonsmoking), a blank, then a `<tt>B</tt>' or a `<tt>T</tt>' (booth or table).
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</a></font></h2>
<p>
For each reservation request
which can be satisfied, your program should then print the list of table
numbers or the table/booth number and the number of minutes the party will
have to wait after their arrival.  If a request cannot be satisfied,
print `<tt>Impossible</tt>'.
