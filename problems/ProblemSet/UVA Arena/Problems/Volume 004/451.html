<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</a></font></h2>
<p>The input will contain several test cases. First line of the input is the an
integer which indicate the number of test case followed by a blank line.&nbsp;Each
consecutive test case will also separated by a blank line.</p>
<p>
Each test case gets 25 cards, 5 cards per line. Each card consists
 of two characters. The first represents the rank of the card: `A', `2',
     `3', `4', `5', `6', `7', `8', `9', `X', `J', `Q', `K'.
     The second represents the suit of the card: `S', `H', `D', `C'.
<p>
<p>
     The cards are dealt into a  <img width="37" height="24" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline44" src="451img1.gif">  square.  Each row and column is
     evaluated to determine the highest hand type for which its 5 cards
     qualify.  The hand types, from low to high, are Nothing, Pair, Two
     Pair, Three of a Kind, Straight, Flush, Full House, Four of a Kind,
     Straight Flush.  A hand qualifies only once, and then only for its
     highest type.  For example, a Four of a Kind does not count as two
     pair or three of a kind.
