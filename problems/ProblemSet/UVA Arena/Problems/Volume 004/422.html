The Pyrates Restaurant was starting to fill up as Valentine McKee walked in.
She scanned the
crowd for her sister, brother-in-law, and nephew. Seeing her sister waving
from the far end of
the restaurant, she made her way back to their booth. ``Hi, Valentine,'' her
sister and brother-in-law, Niki and Dennis Chapman, greeted her.
<p>
``Hi, guys,'' she replied. ``What are you doing, Wade?'' she asked her
nephew. He was busy
working on one of the restaurant's activity sheets with a crayon.
<p>
``I'm doing a word search game,'' Wade explained. ``I have to find all of
these words in this
big mess of letters. This is really hard.'' Wade looked intently at the
paper in front of him.
<p>
``Can I help?'' asked Valentine, looking across the table at the activity sheet.
<p>
``Sure. These are the words we're looking for. They're the names of different
kinds of Planes, Trains, and Automobiles.''

<p>
The first line of input will specify the length (in characters) of the
sides of the letter matrix (the
matrix of letters will be square). The length, <i>l</i>, will be in the
range  <img width="85" height="26" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline28" src="422img1.gif"> . The next <i>l</i> lines of input will
be the matrix itself, each line will contain <i>l</i> uppercase letters.
<p>
A list of words will follow. Each word will be on a line by itself; there
will be 100 or fewer
words. Each word will be 100 or fewer characters long, and will only
contain uppercase letters.
<p>
The final line of input will contain a single zero character.
<p>

<p>
Your program should attempt to find each word from the word list in the
puzzle. A word is
``found'' if all the characters in the word can be traced in a
single (unidirectional) horizontal,
vertical, or diagonal line in the letter matrix. Words may
not ``wrap around'' rows or columns,
but horizontal and diagonal words may proceed from right to
left (``backwards''). For each
word that is found, your program should print the coordinates of its
first and last letters in the
matrix on a single line, separated by a single space. Coordinates are
pairs of comma-separated
integers (indexed from 1), where the first integer specifies the row
number and the second integer specifies the column number.
<p>
If a word is not found, the string ``<tt>Not found</tt>'' should be output
instead of a pair of coordinates.
<p>
Each word from the input can be ``found'' at most once in the puzzle.
