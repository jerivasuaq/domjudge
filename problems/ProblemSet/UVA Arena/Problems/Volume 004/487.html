<p>
In the game of Boggle, you are presented with an  <img width="51" height="24" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline43" src="487img1.gif">  table of letters. The object is to find words
in the mix of letters. A word may be started anywhere in the table and is constructed by forming a chain of adjacent letters. Adjacent means diagonal, vertical or horizontal. A word cannot use any character from the table more than once.
<p>
<p>
Here is an example of a  <img width="38" height="24" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline45" src="487img2.gif">  table:
<tt>bile</tt> <br> 
<tt>tglp</tt> <br> 
<tt>aest</tt> <br> 
<tt>here</tt>
<p>
<p>
The following is a partial list of legal words that can be found using the above rules:
<pre>bill
gates
slept
here</pre>
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</a></font></h2>
<p>
The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating
the number of the cases following, each of them as described below. This line is
followed by a blank line, and there is also a blank line between two consecutive
inputs.
<p>
In ``Boggle Blitz'' you will be given an integer number, <i>N</i>, on a single line. <i>N</i> is the number of characters on each side of the table, giving a total of  <img width="21" height="14" align="BOTTOM" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline51" src="487img3.gif">  characters. <i>N</i> can range from 1 to 20. <i>N</i>
lines of <i>N</i> characters each will follow giving you the arrangement of the table.
<p>
Your task is to find
all the legal words in the table. <tt>Be sure that your program is efficient!</tt>
<p>
In case you forgot to bring a dictionary, you are in luck because we are not using English words.
Instead, we have redefined ``word'' to mean an increasing (by ASCII value) chain of characters
from length 3 to length  <img width="21" height="14" align="BOTTOM" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline51" src="487img3.gif"> . ``<tt>ABCDE</tt>'' is a legal five letter word. ``<tt>MICROSOFT</tt>'' is <b>not legal</b>
because the sequence is not increasing. ``<tt>BILL</tt>'' is also illegal because <tt>L</tt> is not greater than <tt>L</tt>.
``<tt>BIL</tt>'', however, is legal.

<p>
For each test case, the output must follow the description below. The outputs of
two consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.
<p>
Your program should output the list of unique words sorted according to the following
criteria:
<ol><li> Shorter words are before longer words<li> Words are sorted
    lexigraphically by ASCII value
</li></li></ol>
<p>
Add no blank lines or spaces. If no legal words can be found, print nothing.
