<p>
The owner of a successful small business is so busy that she requires all of her appointments
to be scheduled two weeks in advance. She has contacted you to write a program that
will help her automate this process. Her work week lasts from 9:00am to 5:00pm, Monday
through Friday. She leaves for lunch at 12:30pm and returns at 1:30pm each day.
<p>
During the week, she collects appointment requests for two weeks in advance in the order
that they were made. Your program will process the requests in the same order, effectively
giving priority to those requests that were made the earliest. After running your program,
she will confirm the scheduled appointments and reschedule those appointements that the
program could not arrange for her.
<p>
She asks that your program schedule her appointments in ten-minute blocks that begin
on the hour and at ten, twenty, thirty, forty, and fifty minutes past the hour. Any requests
that do not begin and/or end at these ten-minute points in time must be scheduled between
the ten-minute points which encompass them. For example, an appointment request for
10:15am to 10:30am would be scheduled from 10:10am to 10:30am.
<p>
She also wants your program to insert a ten minute break after each scheduled appointment so that no two appointments occur in immediate succession. The ten-minute break will
occupy the next ten-minute block in her schedule. Ten-minute breaks are not to be added
for appointments which can be scheduled to end at 12:30pm or 5:00pm. No appointment
is permitted to extend into the lunch period, or to be scheduled to begin during the lunch
period. She would like no more than four hours of appointments scheduled on any one day.
When computing the four-hour limit, use the adjusted length of the appointment (do not
use the original request and do not include the ten-minute breaks which follow the adjusted
appointment times). Thus, the appointment request for 10:15am to 10:30am contributes 20
minutes to the four-hour time limit for that day.
<p>
Finally, the owner tells you that if an appointment cannot be scheduled as requested, your
program should attempt to reschedule the appointment at the same time on each successive
day of the week, scheduling it on the first day that it fits: if an appointment cannot be
scheduled at 10:00am on Wednesday, your program should try to schedule it on Thursday at
10:00am, then at Friday at 10:00am if it cannot be scheduled on Thursday (do not attempt
to schedule the appointment earlier in the week or at different times of the day). If your
program cannot schedule the appointment in this manner, the name of the person requesting
the appointment should be added to the list of appointments that could not be scheduled.

<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</a></font></h2>
<p>
The input file will consist of at most 25 appointment requests on a separate line in the
following format:
<p> <img width="355" height="16" align="BOTTOM" alt="displaymath30" src="480img1.gif"> <p>
where the name field occupies the first ten character positions of the request, the day field
occupies the next three character positions, and the remaining two fields each consist of
a pair of integers. The name field will contain ten alphanumeric characters and the day
field will contain one of the three character sequences: <tt>MON</tt>, <tt>TUE</tt>, <tt>WED</tt>, <tt>THU</tt>, or <tt>FRI</tt>.
Following the day will be two times: the starting time of an appointment request, and its
duration. Both times consist of two integers, hours followed by minutes. For example, the
appoint request:
<pre>Johnstone TUE 09 15 1 30</pre>
means that Johnstone requests an appointment for the Tuesday of that week starting at
9:15am for one hour and thirty minutes. Since the schedule is in ten-minute blocks, your
program would attempt to schedule the appointment for Tuesday from 9:10am to 10:50am
(adding 1 hour and 40 minutes to the total appointment time on Tuesday).
<p>
Your program
may assume that all fields in an appointment request will contain legitimate data and that
times will be expressed in terms of the maximal number of hours (9:15am will always be 9
15 rather than 8 75 and ninety minutes will always be 1 30 rather than 0 90).
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</a></font></h2>
<p>
Your output will consist of a schedule for the week followed by a summary listing the names
of those people whose appointments could not be scheduled during this time. Days with no
scheduled appointments should be noted.
