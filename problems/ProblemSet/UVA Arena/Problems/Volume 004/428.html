<p>
The Swamp County Environmental Office is concerned about the number of
structures in the county.  They have a theory that all the rain water
landing on roofs of buildings, parking lots, roads, and highways is going
down the sewage system instead of draining to the ecologically
sensitive and historically important swamp land the county is famous
for.
<p>
<p>
Your team has been hired to do the analysis of rain water captured by
building roofs.  The Planning Commission, which processes all building
permits, and hence knows the plans of every structure in the county, will
provide the data.  Their database contains a set of measurements for
the roofs of every building on every lot in the county.
<p>
<p>
The Engineering staff of the Planning Commission has determined that all
the roofs in the county can be represented by one or more
quadrilaterals.  Each quadrilateral has the following characteristics:
<p>
<ul><li> length of baseline, in feet;<li> length of ridgeline, in feet;<li> distance between baseline and ridgeline, in feet;<li> and inclination of the roof segment, in degrees.
</li></li></li></li></ul>
<p>
The baseline is always parallel to the ridgeline.  A roof segment is
always flat, but may be inclined.  The inclination of the segment occurs
along the baseline or ridgeline axis.  A roof segment that is inclined
90 degrees is a wall that is assumed to have negligible
thickness, and hence gathers no rain--such a segment will not appear in the
data.  Assume that the buildings are on level land, and that no
roof segment overlaps any other.  A roof segment may have either a baseline or
ridgeline length of zero (such a segment is actually a
triangle).  A lot may contain one or more buildings, but your program need only
compute the area covered by roofs on a lot-by-lot basis.
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</a></font></h2>
<p>
Each lot is represented by a series of numbers separated from each other
by white space
and/or new-lines.  The lot size, in square feet, is followed by a list
of roof segments.  Each roof segment will consist of the length of the
baseline, the length of the ridgeline, the distance between the
baseline and the ridgeline, and the inclination.  Each lot description 
including the last will end with a blank line.
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</a></font></h2>
<p>
For each lot compute and print the following statistics:  the total
roof surface area of buildings in square feet,
the total floor space covered by roofs in square feet,
and the percentage of rain intercepted by roofs.  Print these values in
labeled columns, one lot per line, with two digits after the decimal point.
Print percent signs after the percentage of rain figures.
<p>
<p>
At the end of the run compute and print the following statistics:  the
total roof surface area of all roofs in the county,
the total floor space covered by roofs in the county,
the overall percentage of rain intercepted by roofs,
the average roof surface area on a lot, 
and the average floor space covered by roofs on a lot.  Skip a line after the
per-lot listing and print these values on separate lines with appropriate 
labels.
<p>
Print each value with two digits after the decimal point.  Print a
percent sign after the overall percentage of rain value.  Use a report format
similar to that of the sample output below.
<p>
<p>
One of the reasons Swamp County has remained so is the relative lack of
wind in the county--you may therefore assume that all rain falls vertically.
