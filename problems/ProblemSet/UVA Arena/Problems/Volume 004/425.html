One Saturday morning, Valentine McKee attempted to log into <tt>kevin.bit.edu</tt>,
the new BIT
supercomputer, to work on her new MPI implementation. After a few failed
login attempts,
Valentine put her head in her hands. ``I can't believe it! I've forgotten
my password!''
<p>
<p>
Valentine thought for a few minutes. She remembered choosing her password
as a combination of two words from the body of her thesis.
The password program on <tt>kevin</tt> had required
her to make the password between 5 and 8 characters long with at least
one ``special'' character
(non-alpha), so Valentine had also incorporated a numeral into the
password. ``Either 0, 2, 4,
or 8, between the two words,'' she recalled. Also, to save typing
effort, she had used only
lowercase for the letters. She could not recall, however, whether or not the
original words had
been all lowercase. She did recall that both words were longer than just
a single character.
<p>
<p>
Valentine started to read through the most recent printout of her
thesis, trying to jog her
memory of the password, but to no avail. Finally, she
said, ``My thesis is on line in my lab and I
have a record there of my encrypted password. I never thought I would
have to use it, though.''
<p>
<p>
She sighed as she invoked man <tt>crypt</tt> to determine how <tt>crypt()</tt>
processes passwords.

<b>NAME</b>
<blockquote> crypt - generate encryption
</blockquote>
<p>
SYNOPSIS
<blockquote> <b>char</b> *<b>crypt(const char</b> *<em>key</em>, <b>const char</b> *<em>salt</em>);
</blockquote>
<p>
DESCRIPTION
<ul><dt>
<dd>
<p>
<b>crypt( )</b> is the password encryption function. It is based on a
one-way encryption algorithm with variations intended (among other things)
to frustrate use of hardware implementations of a key search.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<em>key</em> is the input string to encrypt, for instance, a user's typed
password. Only the first eight characters
are used; the rest are ignored. <em>salt</em> is a two-character string chosen
from the set [<b>a-zA-Z0-9./</b>]; this
string is used to perturb the hashing algorithm in one of 4096 different
ways, after which the input string
is used as the key to repeatedly encrypt a constant string. The returned
value points to the encrypted
input string. The first two characters of the return value are
the <em>salt</em> itself.
</dd></dt></ul>
<p>
NOTES
<blockquote> 
The return value for <b>crypt( )</b> points to static data that are
overwritten by each call.
<p>
<p>
<p>
The <b>crypt( )</b> function is provided for you. You do not have to
write it yourself.

<p>
Include the following in your program so that you can properly call the
<tt>pcrypt()</tt> procedure (a
wrapper to the C <tt>crypt()</tt> function). The <tt>pcrypt()</tt> procedure is a
library procedure that we will supply -- you do not have to write it.

<pre>type
   key_type = array[1..8] of char;
   salt_type = array[1..2] of char;
   encrypt_type = array[1..32] of char;

procedure pcrypt( key : key_type;
                  salt : salt_type;
              var result : encrypt_type); external c;</pre>

<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Input</a></font></h2>
<p>
The first line of input is the encrypted password. The next lines of
input are the contents of
Valentine's thesis. Each input line will consist of 80 or fewer characters
of printable ASCII
text and will be terminated by a newline. No lines will be empty. Words
are assumed to be
any contiguous set of alphabetic characters (upper or lower case),
separated by whitespace or punctuation.
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001003000000000000000">Output</a></font></h2>
<p>
The output of the program is Valentine's original password.

The parallel algorithms were executed on the Connection Machine model
CM-2 --- a single-instruction multiple data (SIMD) parallel computer
which, in its largest configuration, contains 65,536 bit-serial
processors and 2048 Weitek floating-point units (FPU's).
The bit-serial processors are clustered together into groups of 16
within a single integrated circuit, and these IC's are connected
together in a 12-dimensional hypercube. Two IC's, or 32 processors,
share a single Weitek FPU. Note that a fully configured CM-2 contains
2048 times as much floating point hardware as a conventional computer
containing a single Weitek FPU (e.g., a SUN-4).</pre>
