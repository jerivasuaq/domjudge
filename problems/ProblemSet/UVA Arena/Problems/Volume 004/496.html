After graduating from the University of Notre Dame, you obtained a job
at Top Shelf Software, Inc., as an
entry-level computer engineer. On the first day, your manager sits down
with you and tasks you with the
following job: ``We want to see how well you understand computer programming
and the abstract science
behind it. As an evaluation for all of our new hires, we require them
to write a program to determine the
relationship between pairs of sets. I'm quite sure that you'll do well;
my confidence is high. Here's a list of
requirements for what the program should do. Good luck.''
<p>

<p>
Your program should accept an even number of lines of text. Each pair of
lines will represent two sets;
the first line represents set A, the second line represents set B.
Each line of text (set) will be a list of distinct integers.
<p>

<p>
After each pair of lines has been read in, the sets should be compared
and one of the following responses should be output:
<ul><li> <tt>A is a proper subset of B</tt><li> <tt>B is a proper subset of A</tt><li> <tt>A equals B</tt><li> <tt>A and B are disjoint</tt><li> <tt>I'm confused!</tt>
