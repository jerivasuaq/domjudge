The famous painter Mel Borp is working on a brilliant series of paintings that introduce a
new experimental style of Modern Art. At first glance, these paintings look deceptively simple,
since they consist only of triangles of different sizes that seem to be stacked on top of each other.
Painting these works, however, takes an astonishing amount of consideration, calculation, and
precision since all triangles are painted without taking the brush off the canvas. How exactly Mel
paints his works is a well-kept secret.
<p>
Recently, he started on the first painting of his new series.
It was a single triangle, titled  <img width="27" height="26" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline176" src="432img1.gif"> .
After that, he created  <img width="28" height="26" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline178" src="432img2.gif"> , the basis for his other works (see Figure 1).

<strong>Figure:</strong> Early work:  <img width="27" height="26" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline176" src="432img1.gif">  (left) and  <img width="28" height="26" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline178" src="432img2.gif">  (right).<br>
<p>
<p>
Then he decided to take his experimenting one step further, and he painted  <img width="28" height="26" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline184" src="432img4.gif">  and  <img width="27" height="26" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline186" src="432img5.gif"> .
Compare Figure 1 and Figure 2 to fully appreciate the remarkable progression in his work.

<strong>Figure:</strong> Advanced work:  <img width="28" height="26" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline184" src="432img4.gif">  (left) and  <img width="27" height="26" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline186" src="432img5.gif">  (right).<br>
<p>
<p>
Note that the shape of the painting can be deduced from its title,  <img width="27" height="26" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline192" src="432img7.gif"> , as follows:
<p>
<ul><li>  <img width="27" height="26" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline176" src="432img1.gif">  is a single triangle (see Figure 1);<li>  <img width="28" height="26" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline178" src="432img2.gif">  consists of a smaller, inverted triangle placed inside  <img width="27" height="26" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline176" src="432img1.gif"> 
, so that the result consists of four smaller triangles (see Figure 1);<li> if <i>p</i> &gt; 0 and <i>q</i> &gt; 1, then the painting looks like  <img width="44" height="26" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline204" src="432img8.gif"> , except that an inverted triangle has been placed inside the bottom-right triangle of  <img width="44" height="26" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline204" src="432img8.gif"> , splitting it into four smaller triangles (compare for example  <img width="28" height="26" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline178" src="432img2.gif">  and  <img width="28" height="26" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline184" src="432img4.gif">  );<li> if <i>p</i> &gt; 1 and <i>q</i> &gt; 0, the painting looks like  <img width="44" height="26" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline216" src="432img9.gif"> 
, except that an inverted triangle has been
placed inside the bottom-left triangle of  <img width="44" height="26" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline216" src="432img9.gif"> 
, splitting it into four smaller triangles;<li> other values of <i>p</i> and <i>q</i>: it is not a valid title of a painting.
</li></li></li></li></li></ul>
<p>
The triangles of a painting look all the same (each triangle is an isosceles triangle with two
sides of the same length), but their height and width depend on the size of the canvas Mel used.
<p>
<p>
Mel wanted to end the series with  <img width="41" height="26" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline224" src="432img10.gif"> , the most complex painting he thought he would be
able to paint. But no matter how many times he tried, he could not get it right. Now he is
desperate, and he hopes you can help him by writing a program that prints, in order, the starting
and ending coordinates of the lines Mel has to paint. Of course, you will need to know how Mel
paints his works, so we will now reveal his secret technique.
<p>
<p>
As an example, take a look at  <img width="28" height="26" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline184" src="432img4.gif">  (see Figure 3):
<p>
<p><a name="174">&#160;</a> <img width="192" height="234" align="BOTTOM" alt="figure78" src="432img11.gif"> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong>  <img width="28" height="26" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline184" src="432img4.gif"> .<br>
<p>
<p>
Mel always starts at the top of the top triangle, drawing a line straight to the lower-left corner
of the lower left triangle (in this example, 1-2), continuing with a line to the lower-right corner of
that triangle (in this example, 2-3). Next, he works his way up by drawing a line to the top of that
triangle (in this example, 3-4). Now he has either reached the starting point again (finishing yet
another masterpiece) or he has reached the lower-left corner of another triangle (in this example,
1-4-5). In the latter case, he continues by drawing the bottom line of that triangle (4-5) and after
that he starts working on the triangle or triangles that is or are located underneath the lower-right
corner of that triangle, in the same way. So he continues with (5-3), (3-6), (6-7), (7-8), (8-6), (6-9),
and (9-1) as the finishing touch.

<p>
The first line of the input contains the number of test cases. Each test case consists of one line
containing four non-negative integers <i>p</i>, <i>q</i>, <i>x</i>, and <i>y</i>, separated by spaces.  <img width="27" height="26" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline192" src="432img7.gif">  is the title of the
painting and (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) are the coordinates of the top of the top triangle. Further,  <img width="66" height="25" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline242" src="432img12.gif">  and <i>x</i>,<i>y</i> &lt; 32768. All triangles have a nonzero area.
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output Specification</a></font></h2>
<p>
For every test case, the output contains the pairs of (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) integer coordinates of the starting and
ending points of all lines Mel has to draw for the painting  <img width="27" height="26" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline192" src="432img7.gif"> 
in the right order, in the format
<p> <img width="364" height="18" align="BOTTOM" alt="displaymath250" src="432img13.gif"> <p>
followed by a newline. The output for each test case must be followed by an empty line.
