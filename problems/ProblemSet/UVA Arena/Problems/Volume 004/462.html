<p>
In the card game ``Bridge'', players must assess the strength of their
hands prior to bidding against one another. Most players use a
point-count scheme which employs the following rules:
<ol><li> Each ace counts 4 points. Each king counts 3 points. Each queen
counts 2 points. Each jack counts one point.<li> Subtract a point for any king of a suit in which the hand holds
no other cards.<li> Subtract a point for any queen in a suit in which the hand holds
only zero or one other cards.<li> Subtract a point for any jack in a suit in which the hand holds
only zero, one, or two other cards.<li> Add a point for each suit in which the hand contains exactly two
cards.<li> Add two points for each suit in which the hand contains exactly one
card.<li> Add two points for each suit in which the hand contains no
cards. 
</li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ol>
<p>
A suit is <em>stopped</em> if it contains an ace, or if it contains a
king and at least one other card, or if it contains a queen and at
least two other cards.
<p>
<p>
During the opening assessment, the three most common possibilities are:
<p>
<ul><li> If the hand evaluates to fewer than 14 points, then the player
must pass.<li> One may open bidding in a suit if the hand evaluates to 14 or
more points. Bidding is always opened in one of the suits with the
most cards.<li> One may open bidding in ``no trump'' if the hand evaluates to 16
or more points <em>ignoring rules 5, 6, and 7</em> and if all four suits
are stopped. A no trump bid is always preferred over a suit bid when
both are possible.

<p>
Input to your program consists of a series of lines, each line containing
 13 cards.  Each card
consists of two characters.  The first represents the rank of the
card: `A', `2', `3', `4', `5', `6', `7', `8', `9', `T', `J', `Q', `K'.
The second represents the suit of the card: `S', `H', `D', `C',
standing for ``spades'', ``hearts'', ``diamonds'', and ``clubs'',
respectively.
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</a></font></h2>
<p>
For each line of the input, print one line containing the recommended bid, either ``<tt>PASS</tt>'', the first ``<tt>BID </tt><em>suit</em>'', where <em>suit</em> is ``S'', ``H'', ``D'', or ``C'' (sorted in this natural way if two or more are possible), or ``<tt>BID NO-TRUMP</tt>''.
<p>
<p>
For the first example below,
the evaluation starts with 6 points for the two kings, 4 for the ace,
6 for the three queens, and one for the jack. To this tally of 17
points, we add 1 point for having only two cards in spades, and
subtract 1 for having a queen in spaces with only one other card in
spades. The resulting 17 points is enough to justify opening in a
suit.
<p>
The evaluation for <em>no-trump</em> is 16 points, since we cannot count
the one point for having only two spades. We cannot open in no-trump,
however, because the hearts suit is not stopped.
<p>
Hence we must open bidding in a suit. The two longest suits are clubs
and diamonds, with four cards each, so the possible outputs are
``<tt>BID C</tt>'',  or ``<tt>BID D</tt>''.
