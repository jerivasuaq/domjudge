But then God saw that <tt>vi</tt> led people into temptation. Instead of choosing the righteous ways of <tt>make</tt>,
<tt>dbx</tt>, and <tt>RCS</tt>, people used long command lines, <tt>printf()</tt>, and tape backups.
<p>
So God decreed, ``I see that Engineers have thus defiled my <tt>vi</tt>. And so, I shall create <em>emacs</em>, an editor
more powerful than words. Further, for each instantiation <tt>vi</tt> hitherto, the Engineer responsible shalt perform
Penance. And lo, the Penance wilt be painful; there will be much wailing and gnushingof teeth. The Engineer
will read many lines of text. For each line of text, the Engineer must tell me which letters occur the most frequently.''
<p>
``I charge you all with My Golden Rule: 'Friends shalt not let friends use <tt>vi</tt>'.''

<p>
Each line of output should contain a list of letters that all occured with the highest frequency in the corresponding input line, followed by the frequency.
<p>
The list of letters should be an alphabetical list of upper case letters followed by an alphabetical
list of lower case letters.
