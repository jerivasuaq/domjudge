<p>
Many electronic devices have digital read-outs that are made using
light-emitting diode (LED) arrays. A
common digital display element uses seven, bar-shaped LED's, with the
seven LED bars (segments) arranged and identified as:
<center><img src="416img4.gif"></center>
<p>
Digits are displayed by illuminating various combinations of the seven
segments in accordance with the following table:
<p>
<center><img src="416img5.gif"></center>
<p>
For example, the digit three (3) would be displayed as the illumination of
the segments {<tt>a</tt>,<tt>b</tt>,<tt>c</tt>,<tt>d</tt>,<tt>g</tt>} as:
<p>

<p>
The problem below is abstracted from one occurring in the incoming-parts
inspection department, in a
microwave-oven manufacturing facility. The incoming seven-segment LED's are
checked for their proper
functioning by automated equipment running under programmable control.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> The solution to the problem below will not be a
complete nor necessarily useful test for the actual inspections that
would be conducted.
<p>
<p>
You are to create a program that will observe successive sets of illumination
conditions of the seven segments of a single-digit display,
and decide whether the sequence of illuminations could have been a valid
``count down&quot; sequence.
<p>
<p>
Unfortunately, for the LED your program is to observe, some of the segments
may be burned out at the start
of your test, and additional segments may burn out during the test. No
segments will everfail into the ON
mode; no burned out segments will recover. Nevertheless, you are expected
to be able to ``read&quot; through the
ambiguities this malfunctioning display presents, by watching the display
count down through one or more values.

<p>
The input consists of a series of data sets having the following format:
<p>
<dl><dt><strong>First line -</strong>
<dd> A single unsigned integer, N, with value greater than zero (0)
and less than eleven (11). The integer is left-justified on the input line.
<p>
<dt><strong>Next <i>N</i> lines -</strong>
<dd> Each line has a string of seven (7) contiguous <tt>Y</tt>/<tt>N</tt> characters showing the light condition of
the segments of the LED display. These successive lines supposedly
represent a ``count down&quot; sequence.
The first of these seven characters, the illumination reading for the ``<tt>a</tt>&quot;
segment, will be the first character on a line.
<p>
 </dd></dt></dd></dt></dl>
<p>
The end of data is signaled by a null data set having a zero on the first
line and no further data.
<p>
<p>
There is no information about where the ``count down&quot; sequence begins for
a given data set. There is no
information that carries over from one data set to the next; each data set
represents a <i>different</i> LED being tested.
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</a></font></h2>
<p>
Foreach supposed ``count down&quot; sequence you receive as a data set, you are
to reply either:
<pre>MATCH</pre>
-or-
<pre>MISMATCH</pre>
<p>
depending on whether this sequence could possibly be a valid ``count down&quot;
sequence <i>somewhere</i> within
the sequence { 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0 } if an unknown number of
burned-out segments were present at the
beginning of the test, and, with possible burn-outs occurring during the
test. Your output must be at the beginning of the line.
