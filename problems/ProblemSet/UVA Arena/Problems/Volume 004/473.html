<p>
You just inherited the rights to <i>n</i> previously unreleased songs recorded by the popular group Raucous Rockers.
You plan to release a set of <i>m</i> compact disks with a selection
of these songs.
Each disk can hold a maximum of <i>t</i> minutes of music, and a song can not overlap from one disk
to another.
Since you are a classical music fan and have no way to judge the artistic
merits of these songs, you decide on the following criteria for making the selection:
<ol><li> The  songs will be recorded on the set of disks in the order of the dates they were written.<li>
The total number of songs included will be maximized.
</li></li></ol><h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</a></font></h2>
<p>
The input consists of several datasets. The first line of the input indicates the number of datasets, then there is a blank line and the datasets separated by a blank line. Each dataset consists of a line containing the values of <i>n</i>, <i>t</i> and <i>m</i>
(integer numbers) followed by a line containing a list of the length of <i>n</i> songs,  <img width="81" height="23" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline43" src="473img1.gif">  ordered by
the date they were written (Each  <img width="11" height="23" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline45" src="473img2.gif">  is between 1 and t minutes long, both inclusive, and  <img width="119" height="27" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline49" src="473img3.gif"> .)

<b>The output</b> for each dataset consists of one integer indicating the number of songs that, following the
above selection criteria will fit on <i>m</i> disks. Print a blank line between consecutive datasets.
