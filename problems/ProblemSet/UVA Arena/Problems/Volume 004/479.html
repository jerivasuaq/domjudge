<p>
The Mishawaka Irrigation company builds custom designed pipeline irrigation systems for farmers and ranchers. One such irrigation system is shown below (it matches the first dataset in the example input, where flow rates are 200, 40 and 74):
<p>

<p>
For the above example, three wells provide water for the irrigation system and a variety of valve settings  are used to control the amount of water that is delivered to each of the three sprinkler systems. Furthermore, the flow of water occurs only in the
direction indicated by the arrows. Each valve can be set to the right (in which case all the
water is diverted to the right), or to the left (in which case all the water is diverted to the left).
<p>
Given a sprinkler system configuration and each well's corresponding flow rate (in gallons/minute), your program should determine, for different valve settings, the output flow rates that are being delivered to each sprinkler systems.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> You should program for generality (i.e., do not make any assumptions concerning the number of water wells, flow
valve settings, or sprinkler heads. Also do not make assumptions about the names of the components).

<p>
The input file will consist of multiple data sets; each data set is terminated by an asterisk (<tt>*</tt>)
on a line by itself. Each data set will consist of an irrigation network description (see table 1)
followed by one or more flow valve setting records (see table 2). Each flow valve setting record
consists of a sequence of <tt>L</tt>'s and <tt>R</tt>'s, one for each valve described in the irrigation network
description. The datasets are separated by lines containing only an asterisk (<tt>*</tt>) in column one.
<p>
End of data is marked by a terminal record containing the values of 9999 for #ofWells, #ofSprinklers, and #ofValves.

<p>
For each set of valve settings of each irrigation network, your program should output a
message of the following form:
<p>
<p>
<tt>Sprinkler #<i>i</i> flow is <i>n</i> gallons/min</tt>
<p>
<p>
Label the output for each irrigation network according to the order in which it was inputted (see the example below). Label the outputs for the valve settings in the order in which they were read in for each irrigation network. See the example for the exact format of the output headings and spacing.
