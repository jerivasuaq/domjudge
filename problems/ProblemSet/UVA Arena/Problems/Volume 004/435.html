Different types of electoral systems exist. In a block voting system the members of a party do
not vote individually as they like, but instead they must collectively accept or reject a proposal.
Although a party with many votes clearly has more power than a party with few votes, the votes
of a small party can nevertheless be crucial when they are needed to obtain a majority. Consider
for example the following five-party system:
<p>
<p> <img width="130" height="133" align="BOTTOM" alt="tabular21" src="435img1.gif"> <p>
<p>
Coalition {A,B} has 7 + 4 = 11 votes, which is not a majority. When party C joins coalition
{A,B}, however, {A,B,C} becomes a winning coalition with 7+4+2 = 13 votes. So even though C is a small party, it can play an important role.
<p>
As a measure of a party's power in a block voting system, John F. Banzhaf III proposed to use the <em>power index</em>. The key idea is that a party's power is determined by the number of minority
coalitions that it can join and turn into a (winning) majority coalition. Note that the empty
coalition is also a minority coalition and that a coalition only forms a majority when it has more
than half of the total number of votes. In the example just given, a majority coalition must have at least 13 votes.
<p>
In an ideal system, a party's power index is proportional to the number of members of that party.
<p>
<p>
Your task is to write a program that, given an input as shown above, computes for each party
its power index.

<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input Specification</a></font></h2>
<p>
The first line contains a single integer which equals the number of test cases that follow. Each of
the following lines contains one test case.
<p>
The first number on a line contains an integer <i>P</i> in [1  <img width="20" height="2" align="BOTTOM" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline36" src="435img2.gif">  20] which equals the number of parties for that test case. This integer is followed by <i>P</i> positive integers, separated by spaces. Each of these integers represents the number of members of a party in the electoral system. The <i>i</i>-th number represents party number <i>i</i>. No electoral system has more than 1000 votes.
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output Specification</a></font></h2>
<p>
For each test case, you must generate <i>P</i> lines of output, followed by one empty line. <i>P</i> is the number of parties for the test case in question. The <i>i</i>-th line (<i>i</i> in [ <img width="47" height="12" align="BOTTOM" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline52" src="435img3.gif"> ]) contains the sentence:
<p>
<tt>party <i>i</i> has power index <i>I</i></tt>
<p>
where <i>I</i> is the power index of party <i>i</i>.
