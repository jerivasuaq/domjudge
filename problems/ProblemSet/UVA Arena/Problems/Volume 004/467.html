<p>
On your way to work wach morning you travel down a main traffic artery
regulated by a number of traffic signals. On some mornings, you have
noticed that all of the lights up ahead simultaneously turn green in
your direction. But on other mornings, it seems that a random
combination of red, yellow, and green is facing you.
<p>
<p>
After recently observing all of the lights ahead of you turn green
simultaneously, you began to wonder how long after any one of
them turns to yellow it would take before they
all would be displaying green in your direction again. Write a program
to figure out how long it will take such a set of traffic signals to
all be displaying green again,  given the cycle times for each traffic
signal in the set.
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</a></font></h2>
<p>
The input file will consist of an unknown number of
traffic signal datasets. Each signal dataset will consist of one line
of integers (separated by spaces) giving the total cycle time (in
seconds) for each signal. The <em>cycle time</em> is the total time that
a signal will stay green and yellow in one direction and red in the
opposite direction. In this problem, you may assume that a green
signal will turn yellow for the last 5 seconds of its cycle. If one
set of signals was given as:
<p> <img width="280" height="13" align="BOTTOM" alt="displaymath27" src="467img1.gif"> <p>
your program would need to recognize that there are three signals in
the set, that the first signal lasts 30 seconds, that the second
signal cycles every 25 seconds, and that the thirs signal takes 35
seconds to start a new cycle. Specifically, the first signal will be
red for 30 seconds in one direction, then green for 25 seconds, then
yellow for 5.
<p>
Each set of signals will involve at least two and as many as 10
signals. Each signal will have a minimum cycle time of 10 seconds and
a maximum cycle time of 90 seconds.
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</a></font></h2>
<p>
Your output will consist of a summary line for each
set of signals.  Your program should assign an ID number to each set
of signals, beginning with set 1.  The output line will begin with
the signal set ID number and state the number of minutes ( <img width="35" height="25" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline29" src="467img2.gif"> )
and seconds (&lt; 60)
it will take from when all of the signals simultaneously turn green
initially to the first time they will all be showing green again in
your direction after any of them has turned yellow. Note that this
time may or may not be a time when all of the signals in the set
simultaneously change back to green -- for this problem you need only
indicate how long it will be before all signals in the set are once
again simultaneously <em>showing</em> green in your direction after any
of them has turned to yellow, even if this condition will only exist
for a second or a very few seconds.
<p>
If the signals will never
simultaneously display green in your direction again within an hour,
you should print a message that states that the signals in the set are
not able to synchronize after one hour (note that an output of 60
minutes and 0 seconds should, however, be considered a successful
synchronization).
<p>

Look at the sample output below for the exact format.

Set 2 synchs again at 0 minute(s) and 50 second(s) after all turning green.
Set 3 synchs again at 1 minute(s) and 0 second(s) after all turning green.
Set 4 is unable to synch after one hour.
Set 5 synchs again at 0 minute(s) and 40 second(s) after all turning green.</pre>
