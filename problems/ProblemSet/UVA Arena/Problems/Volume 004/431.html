<p>
In what is becoming known as the &quot;trial of the millennium,&quot; the Swamp County 
District Court is handling the highest profile case ever to reach the 
county court system.  Learning from the experience of people involved in the 
&quot;trial of the century,&quot; the Swamp County judiciary decided to adopt 
a few new rules to avoid gridlock in court proceedings.  Among 
the new rules is a cap on the total amount of time each side is 
allowed to present its case.
<p>
<p>
Each side will be allowed 8 hours for opening arguments, 240 hours for
evidence presentations, and 16 hours for closing arguments.  With this
ground rule set, the court hopes to be able to bring the case to the
jury in less than five months.  While this rule hopefully will
help to ensure a speedier trial, it presents a huge challenge to both 
the prosecution and the defense teams.  Both teams must figure out 
how to best utilize their allocated time slots by presenting the 
most convincing and comprehensible evidence to the jurors.
<p>
<p>
Your team has been contracted by the Swamp County District Attorney's Office to
develop a decision support system to help the prosecution team formulate
its strategies in selecting what material from its pool of evidence to
present.  Since the system may prove to be useful for future trials
that have presentation time limits imposed, the D. A.'s Office has requested 
that you make the system flexible enough to handle other cases.
<p>
<p>
The decision support system will select the material based on the 
score that the prosecution team assigns to each piece of evidence and the 
time cost associated with presenting it to the jury.  The more useful 
the piece of evidence is, the higher its score.  The prosecution team 
therefore has to come up with a set of evidence with the highest 
aggregate score.
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</a></font></h2>
<p>
<b>
The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating 
the number of the cases following, each of them as described below. 
This line is followed by a blank line, and there is also a blank line between 
two consecutive inputs.
</b>
<p>
<p>
Input to the decision support system consists of the total allowed
time for evidence presentation on the first line followed by entries 
for all the evidence that the prosecutor has.  Each line presents one 
piece of evidence, with the first field showing its score, the 
second field indicating the estimated amount of time for its 
presentation, and the third field containing its general 
description.  Fields are separated from each other by spaces, and the third
field may contain embedded spaces.
<p>
<p>
The score is based on a 1-10 integer scale while the time cost is expressed 
in full hours.  
In any given trial, the amount of time allowed for evidence presentation of the prosecution team shall not exceed 240 hours. The 
total number of evidence items shall be less than or equal to 100, and the 
length of the evidence description shall be no greater than 68
characters.  Evidence items may appear in the list in any order.
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</a></font></h2>
<p>
<b>
For each test case, the output must follow the description below. 
The outputs of two consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.
</b>
<p>
<p>
Output will be a list of evidence to be presented along with the cost 
and benefit each of them brings, the aggregate score, and the total
time for their presentation.  Label the columns and the totals, following the
format of the sample output below.
If no evidence can be presented in the time allowed, the program should print 
this single line message:
<p>
<p>
<p>
<tt>There is not enough time to present any evidence. Drop the charges.</tt>
