You've been sitting in front of the terminal for three hours
savagely coding the Assembler assignment that's due tomorrow.
Your best friend, who finished the program last week and has been
rubbing it in for just as long, saunters up to your terminal and
offers, &quot;Coke break, slow poke?&quot;  You take the Coke he hands you
and you lean your head back, savoring the refreshing feeling of
the drink as it soothes your parched throat; too much coding
always made your throat raw.  &quot;Hey, can I look at how far you've
gotten?&quot; your friend asks.  &quot;Sure,&quot; you reply, taking another
long drink.  As you're enjoying your drink and thinking of what
&quot;The Real Thing&quot; really is, you hear a whispered &quot;oops&quot; from the
direction of your terminal.  &quot;What?!&quot; you demand.  Your friend
replies, backing away, &quot;I think I just deleted your source code.&quot;
<p>
<p>
&quot;Arrrgggghhh!&quot; you spurt as your friend runs from the computer
lab, mumbling prayers for divine protection.  You double check
and sure enough all you have left of your precious Assembler
assignment is the executable code from your last compile.  And
you were so close to finishing!  Do you take a zero?  No, that
last test was a killer.  Start over?  NOT!  Instead, your hands
fumble for your Assembler textbook....  Ah, here we go: a
description of the encoding scheme used by the computer's
assembler.  It doesn't look too bad and you remember most of the
hand disassembling you did in class (Thanks Dr. Baber)!  It's
decided then, you'll just have to write a quick disassembler to
convert the executable code back into your source code so that
you can finish your assignment before Cheers comes on.  You open
your textbook and begin reading:

<p>
<tt>ADD</tt> [R,A,N],[R,A] means that the <tt>ADD</tt> instruction takes two
operands.  The first can be a register, an address, or a number,
and the second operand is either a register or an address.
<p>
<p>
Opcodes are 4 bits in length.  An operand is made up of two
fields: a mode and a value.  The mode is two bits and the value
is fourteen bits for a total of sixteen bits.  The possible
values for mode are:
<p>
<p> <img width="239" height="100" align="BOTTOM" alt="tabular51" src="448img2.gif"> <p>
<p>
The value field for a register operand (mode = 00) specifies the
number of the register.  For example, if the value field
contained a seven then that would specify register number 7,
written &quot;<tt>R7</tt>&quot;.  The valid registers are R0 through R1023.
<p>
<p>
The value field for an absolute operand (mode = 01) specifies the
absolute address that the operand is to be stored at.  For
example, if the value field contained the number 110, that would
denote address location 110, which is written &quot;<tt>$110</tt>&quot;.  Valid
addresses are $0 through $16383.
<p>
<p>
The value field for a PC-Relative operand (mode = 10) specifies
the offset of the address relative to the program counter.  (On
this computer, all PC-relative offsets are non-negative).  For
example, if the value field contained the number 45, that would
specify the address location (Program Counter) + 45, which is
written &quot;<tt>PC+45</tt>&quot;.  Valid offsets are from 0 to 16363.
<p>
<p>
The value field for a constant operand (mode = 11) specifies a
constant - a number between 0 and 16383.  For example, if the
value field contained the number 1276, then that would specify
the actual number 1276 and is written as &quot;<tt>1276</tt>&quot;.

<p>
Your task is to write a program which will read in a text file
that contains the hexadecimal listing of an executable program
and output the original source code, one assembler instruction
per line.  Each line in the text file will contain exactly 30
hexadecimal digits except for the last line which will contain
from 1 to 30 hexadecimal digits.
