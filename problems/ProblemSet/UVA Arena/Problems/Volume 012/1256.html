A very important aspect of web portals is customer reviews. The customers can rate any 
product  in the web portal. Generally, a customer can rate a product from one star to 
five star. Based on  the rating of all the customers the average customer rating for a 
product is shown. Look at the  figure to get a clear idea.

<div align="CENTER">

</div>

<p>
For example if 
three customers rate a  product   as   3   star,   4   star   and   4   star  
respectively   then   the   average   rating  will be (3+4+4)/3 = 3.67 (Rounded to  
two digits after the decimal point). In  the   figure   on   the   left   847   
customers  have rated a product and 597, 189, 26, 11 and 24 customers have rated the 
product as 5 star, 4  star,   3   star,   2   star   and   1   star   respectively.   
So   the   average   rating   is:

<div align="CENTER" class="mathdisplay">
<img width="348" height="56" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="4715img2.png" alt="$\displaystyle {\frac{{597 \times 5 + 189 \times 4 + 26 \times 3 + 11 \times 2 + 24 \times 1}}{{847}}}$"> = 4.56316411

(Rounded to eight digits after the decimal point).

Most web portals display the total number of people who have rated the product (As more 
people  rates the product the more reliable the rating is) but do not display the numeric 
value of the  average   rating.  In the  web portal  of warzone (A  renowned web portal)  
the total  number   of  customers that have rated a product (In the figure above the total 
847 customers have rated the  product) and the average rating is stored in two different 
tables. The average rating is stored,  rounded to <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span> (<span class="MATH">0 &lt; <i>n</i> &lt; 9</span>) digits after the decimal point 
so its value is not always the exact average  value. Unfortunately, the table that stored 
the total number of people that rated different products  somehow got corrupted. All 
information available in the database now is the average rating  (rounded to at most eight 
digits after the decimal point). They do not want to lose the huge  number of customer 
ratings they have received throughout 10-­15 years but also they cannot  cheat with their 
customers by guessing the number of raters or voters. So from the average rating  they 
want to determine the minimum possible number of people that rated that product. You  
have to help them find it out by writing a program.

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>
The input file can contain up to 2000 lines of inputs. Each line contains a non-­negative 
floating-­point number <span class="MATH"><i>v</i></span> 
<span class="MATH">(1<img width="18" height="31" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="4715img3.png" alt="$ \le$"><i>v</i><img width="18" height="31" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="4715img3.png" alt="$ \le$">5)</span>. This number will have minimum one digit and maximum 
eight digits after the decimal point. If this number has <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span> digits after the decimal 
point then you have to  assume that the value of the average is given rounded to <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span> digits 
after the decimal point. 

<p>
Input is terminated by a line containing a negative number.

<p>
For each line of input produce one line of output. This line contains the serial of output 
followed  by an integer <span class="MATH"><i>T</i></span> which denotes the minimum number of voter that is required 
for this average  rating.
