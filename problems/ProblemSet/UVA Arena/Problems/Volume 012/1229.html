<p>
In this problem, by the word ``dictionary" we mean a list of alphabetically ordered words and their associated explanations in the same language. A dictionary must contain the definition for any word that appears in the explanation of another word. So you see, if a dictionary defines <span class="MATH"><i>N</i></span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> words, it has exactly <span class="MATH"><i>N</i></span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> distinct words in it. Also, we know that in a dictionary no word appears in the definition of itself. 

<p>
A sub-dictionary is a collection of dictionary's words and their definitions such that it can be published as an independent dictionary, obviously satisfying the mentioned condition. As a project of Computational Linguistics course, we are assigned to create a Lexical Knowledge Base which is the knowledge expressed by words. For this task we should create our knowledge foundation based on a dictionary. 

<p>
It's really hard for the computer to study words automatically. So, we decided to manually teach it some common words. We start from an appropriate sub-dictionary. By understanding its words, a computer could extend its knowledge to the whole dictionary word by word. For instance, a word ``xyz" could be added to the computer's understanding if computer knows the meaning of every words used in xyz's definition. You are asked to write a program that can find the smallest extendable sub-dictionary for a specific dictionary.

The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line of each test case is <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> 
<span class="MATH">(1<img width="18" height="31" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="4099img1.png" alt="$ \le$"><i>n</i><img width="18" height="31" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="4099img1.png" alt="$ \le$">100)</span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, the number of dictionary's words. Each of the next <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> lines contains a word and its definition (that has at most 30 words). Words are separated by blanks and are made up of small English letters less than 25 characters.
