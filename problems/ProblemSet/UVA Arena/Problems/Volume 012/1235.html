Lately, there is one serious problem with Panda Land Safe Box: several safes have been robbed! The safes are using old 4-digits rolling lock combination (you only have to roll the digit, either up or down, until all four of them match the key). Each digit is designed to roll from 0 to 9. Rolling-up at 9 will make the digit become 0, and rolling-down at 0 will make the digit become 9. Since there are only 10000 possible keys, 0000 through 9999, anyone can try all the combinations until the safe is unlocked.

<p>
What's done is done. But in order to slow down future robbers' attack, Panda Security Agency (PSA) has devised a new safer lock with multiple keys. Instead of using only one key combination as the key, the lock now can have up to <span class="MATH"><i>N</i></span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> keys which has to be all unlocked before the safe can be opened. These locks works as the following: 

<p>

<ul>
<li>Initially the digits are at 0000. 
</li>
<li>Keys can be unlocked in any order, by setting the digits in the lock to match the desired key and then pressing the UNLOCK button. 
</li>
<li>A magic JUMP button can turn the digits into any of the unlocked keys without doing any rolling. 
</li>
<li>The safe will be unlocked if and only if all the keys are unlocked in a minimum total amount of rolling, excluding JUMP (yes, this feature is the coolest one). 
</li>
<li>If the number of rolling is exceeded, then the digits will be reset to 0000 and all the keys will be locked again. In other word, the state of the lock will be reset the cracking is failed. 
</li>
</ul>

<p>

<p>

PSA is quite confident that this new system will slow down the cracking, giving them enough time to identify and catch the robbers. In order to determine the minimum number of rolling needed, PSA wants you to write a program. Given all the keys, calculate the minimum number of rolls needed to unlock the safe.

<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, the number of keys. The next <span class="MATH"><i>N</i></span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> lines, each contains exactly four digits number (leading zero allowed) representing the keys to be unlocked.

For each case, print in a single line the minimum number of rolls needed to unlock all the keys.

<span class="textbf">Explanation for the 2nd case:</span> 

<p>

<ul>
<li>Turn <tt>0000</tt> into <tt>1111</tt>, rolls: 4 
</li>
<li>Turn <tt>1111</tt> into <tt>1155</tt>, rolls: 8 
</li>
<li>Jump <tt>1155</tt> into <tt>1111</tt>, we can do this because <tt>1111</tt> has been unlocked before.
</li>
<li>Turn <tt>1111</tt> into <tt>5511</tt>  rolls: 8
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Total rolls = 4 + 8 + 8 = 20
