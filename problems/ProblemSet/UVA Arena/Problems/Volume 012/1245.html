<p>Sita and Gita are smart kids. Generally after completing their homework
they go out for some outdoor games. But it's raining today and they
have to stay home. They decide to break their piggy-bank and count
their savings. They find out that they have accumulated many coins over
the last few months and decide to play a game with these coins. First
they divide the coins into 2 piles containing <strong>X</strong> and <strong>Y</strong> coins respectively.</p>
<p>

</p><p>
Now they start the game by alternating turns. In each turn a player can do one of the following: </p>
<ul>
<li> Remove any number of coins from a single pile.</li>
<li> Remove equal number of coins from both piles.</li>
<li> Pass on the turn to the next player. Note that this still counts as a turn.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The game ends when no move is possible and the player who
cannot make a move loses. Both players play optimally. Being smart,
both players calculate the outcome of the game before the game begins.
The player who loses tries to maximize the number of turns in the game
and player who wins tries to minimize the turns. No player can pass
more than <strong>P</strong> times. Sita starts the game.</p>
