In this problem, you are to solve a very easy linear equation with only one variable <span class="MATH"><i>x</i></span> with no parentheses! An example of such equations is like the following:

<p>
<div align="CENTER" class="mathdisplay">
2<i>x</i> - 4 + 5<i>x</i> + 300 = 98<i>x</i>
</div><p>

<p>
An expression in its general form, will contain a `=' character with two expressions on its sides. Each expression is made up of one or more terms combined by `+' or `-' operators. No unary plus or minus operators are allowed in the expressions. Each term is either a single integer, or an integer followed by the lower-case character <span class="MATH"><i>x</i></span> or the single character <span class="MATH"><i>x</i></span> which is equivalent to <span class="MATH">1<i>x</i></span>.

<p>

<p>
<br>
You are to write a program to find the value of <span class="MATH"><i>x</i></span> that satisfies the equation. Note that it is possible for the equation to have no solution or have infinitely many. Your program must detect these cases too.

<p>
The first number in the input line, <span class="MATH"><i>t</i></span> (
<span class="MATH">1<img width="18" height="30" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="2972img1.gif" alt="$ \le$"><i>t</i><img width="18" height="30" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="2972img1.gif" alt="$ \le$">10</span>) is the number of test cases, followed by <span class="MATH"><i>t</i></span> lines of length at most 255 each containing an equation. There is no blank character in the equations and the variable is always represented by the lower-case character `<tt>x</tt>'. The coefficients are integers in the range (0..1000) inclusive.

Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
The output contains one line per test case containing the solution of the equation. If <span class="MATH"><i>s</i></span> is the solution to the equation, the output line should contain 
<span class="MATH"><img width="12" height="34" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="2972img2.gif" alt="$ \lfloor$"><i>s</i><img width="12" height="34" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="2972img3.gif" alt="$ \rfloor$"></span> (the ``floor" of <span class="MATH"><i>s</i></span>, i.e., the largest integer number less than or equal to <span class="MATH"><i>s</i></span>). The output should be `<tt>IMPOSSIBLE</tt>' or `<tt>IDENTITY</tt>' if the equation has no solution or has infinite solutions, respectively. Note that the output is case-sensitive.
