<p>
You have entered a robot in a Robot Challenge. A course is set up in a 100m by 100m space. 
Certain points are identified within the space as targets. They are ordered -- there is a 
target 1, a target 2, etc. Your robot must start at (0,0). From there, it should go to 
target 1, stop for 1 second, go to target 2, stop for 1 second, and so on. It must 
finally end up at, and stop for a second on, (100,100). 

<p>
Each target except (0,0) and 
(100,100) has a time penalty for missing it. So, if your robot went straight from target 1 
to target 3, skipping target 2, it would incur target 2's penalty. Note that once it hits 
target 3, it cannot go back to target 2. It must hit the targets in order. Since your robot
 must stop for 1 second on each target point, it is not in danger of hitting a target 
accidentally too soon. For example, if target point 3 lies directly between target points 
1 and 2, your robot can go straight from 1 to 2, right over 3, without stopping. Since it 
didn't stop, the judges will not mistakenly think that it hit target 3 too soon, so they 
won't assess target 2's penalty. Your final score is the amount of time (in seconds) your 
robot takes to reach (100,100), completing the course, plus all penalties. Smaller scores 
are better. 

<p>
Your robot is very maneuverable, but a bit slow. It moves at 1 m/s, but can turn 
very quickly. During the 1 second it stops on a target point, it can easily turn to face the 
next target point. Thus, it can always move in a straight line between target points. 

<p>
Because your robot is a bit slow, it might be advantageous to skip some targets, and incur their 
penalty, rather than actually maneuvering to them. Given a description of a course, determine
your robot's best (lowest) possible score.

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>

<p>
There will be several test cases. Each test case will begin with a line with one integer, <span class="MATH"><i>N</i></span> 

<span class="MATH">(1<img width="18" height="31" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="4607img1.png" alt="$ \le$"><i>N</i><img width="18" height="31" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="4607img1.png" alt="$ \le$">1000)</span> which is the number of targets on the course. Each of the next <span class="MATH"><i>N</i></span> lines 
will describe a target with three integers, <span class="MATH"><i>X</i></span>, <span class="MATH"><i>Y</i></span> and <span class="MATH"><i>P</i></span>, where <span class="MATH">(<i>X</i>, <i>Y</i>)</span> is a location on 
the course (

robot misses that target

line after <span class="MATH"><i>N</i></span> is target 1, the next is target 2, and so on. All the targets on a given course 
will be unique -- there will be at most one target point at any location on the course. End of 
input will be marked by a line with a single `<tt>0</tt>'.

Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2> 

<p>
For each test case, output a single decimal number, indicating the smallest 
possible score for that course. Output this number rounded (NOT truncated) to three decimal 
places. Print each answer on its own line, and do not print any blank lines between answers.
