<p>
Write a program that performs symbolic derivation <i>f’(x) = df(x)/dx</i> of a given function <i>f(x)</i>. The function <i>f(x)</i>
is defined by an expression which may contain the following operations: + (addition), - (subtraction), *
(multiplication), / (division), and ln (natural logarithm). Besides, the operands may be the variable x and
numerical constants. The expression may contain arbitrarily nested sub-expressions in parentheses ( ).

<p>
The expression is given in a usual, infix form, such as:

<p align="center">
(2*ln(x+1.7)-x*x)/((-7)+3.2*x*x)+(x+3*x)*x

<p>
Numerical constants have the form d.d, with an optional sign (+ or -), where the number of digits both in integer
and decimal parts are arbitrary. The input expression is guaranteed to be correct (no syntax error can occur).

<p>
The output expression should be written in infix form. It should not be optimized for human reading. This means,
it can contain redundancies, such as 0*x, 1*x, 0+x, etc. The derivation should be performed using the following
rules:

<blockquote>
	<li>The operators * and / are of higher priority than the operators + and -. Parentheses may change
	the priorities as usually.
	<li>The operators +, -, *, and / are left-associative, meaning that they group from left to right:<br>
<pre>		a*b*c = (a*b)*c, a/b/c = (a/b)/c, a/b*c = (a/b)*c, etc.</pre>
	<li>The rules for derivation are:
	<pre>
		(a + b)' = a' + b'
		(a - b)' = a' - b'
		(a * b)' = (a' * b + a * b')
		(a / b)' = (a' * b - a * b') / b^2
			(Note: use b^2 and not (b*b) for presentation)
		ln(a)' = (a')/(a)
		x' = 1
		const' = 0
	</pre>
	<li>While producing the symbolic derivation, use parentheses for output strictly as stated in the
	previous rule. Do not perform presentation optimizations, such as 0*a = 0, 1*a = a, etc.
</li></li></li></li></blockquote>
