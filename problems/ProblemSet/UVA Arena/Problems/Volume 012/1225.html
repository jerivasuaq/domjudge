Trung is bored with his mathematics homeworks. He takes a piece of chalk and starts writing a sequence of consecutive integers starting with 1 to <span class="MATH"><i>N</i></span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> 
<span class="MATH">(1 &lt; <i>N</i> &lt; 10000)</span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>. After that, he counts the number of times each digit (0 to 9) appears in the sequence. For example, with <span class="MATH"><i>N</i> = 13</span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, the sequence is:

<p>
12345678910111213 

<p>
In this sequence, 0 appears once, 1 appears 6 times, 2 appears 2 times, 3 appears 3 times, and each digit from 4 to 9 appears once. After playing for a while, Trung gets bored again. He now wants to write a program to do this for him. Your task is to help him with writing this program.

<p>
The input file consists of several data sets. The first line of the input file contains the number of data sets which is a positive integer and is not bigger than 20. The following lines describe the data sets. 

<p>
For each test case, there is one single line containing the number <span class="MATH"><i>N</i></span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>.

<p>
For each test case, write sequentially in one line the number of digit 
<span class="MATH">0, 1,...9</span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> separated by a space.
