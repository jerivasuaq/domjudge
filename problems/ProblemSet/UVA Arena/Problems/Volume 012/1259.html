Crimes in city of Megacity are going high. To fight the crimes, the authorities have 
created a  highway patrol. The city consists of a number of one-­way roads. At the ends 
of each road, there  is a base station for the patrol troops. Each base station has a 
number of troops. At the beginning,  each station sends a troop along all the outgoing 
highways from that station. The troop patrols the  highway and whenever it reaches the 
station on the other side of the highway, it waits there, and  the troop that has been 
waiting there the most, is sent along the highway that has not been  patrolled the 
longest time.  

<p>
Soon, they faced some difficulties, cause, the frequency of patrolling a highway is more 
and  more dependent on the number of highways that started and ended at the base station. 
If the  number of highways started at a base station is more than the number of highways 
ended there,  the roads are patrolled less frequently. And if, no highways end at some 
base station, then, the  highways started from there, will not be patrolled more than once.  

<p>
In   this   situation,   the   highway   patrol   decided   to   remove   some   highways   
from   the   patrolling  schedule, so that, at each base station, the number of highways 
started and ended at any base  station will be equal. The rest of the highways will be 
monitored using video surveillance. But,  due to some security issues, there are some 
highways that have to be patrolled.  

<p>
Now, given the cost of patrolling highways, and that of installing video surveillance, 
find the  minimum cost of monitoring the whole city. Please keep in mind that, video 
surveillance can not  substitute the highway patrol completely. So, there has to be 
at least one highway that will be  patrolled.
