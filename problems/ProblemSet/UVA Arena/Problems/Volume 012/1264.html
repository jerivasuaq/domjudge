A binary search tree is a binary tree. It may be empty. If it is not empty, it satisfies the following properties: 

<p>
<dl compact="">
<dt>(1)</dt>
<dd>Every node has a key, and no two nodes have the same key. 
</dd>
<dt>(2)</dt>
<dd>The keys in a nonempty left subtree must be smaller than the key in the root of the subtree. 
</dd>
<dt>(3)</dt>
<dd>The keys in a nonempty right subtree must be larger than the key in the root of the subtree. 
</dd>
<dt>(4)</dt>
<dd>The left and right subtrees are also binary search trees. 
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Sample binary search trees are shown in Figure 1.

To search for a node with a key <span class="MATH"><i>k</i></span> in a binary search tree <span class="MATH"><i>T</i></span>, we begin at the root. If <span class="MATH"><i>T</i></span> is empty, <span class="MATH"><i>T</i></span> contains no keys and the search is 
unsuccessful. Otherwise, we compare <span class="MATH"><i>k</i></span> with the key in root. If <span class="MATH"><i>k</i></span> equals root's key, then the search terminates successfully. If <span class="MATH"><i>k</i></span> is 
less than root's key, we search the left subtree of the root. If <span class="MATH"><i>k</i></span> is larger than root's key, we search the right subtree of the root. 
In the same way, we can proceed the search in the left or right subree of <span class="MATH"><i>T</i></span>. 

<p>
To insert a new key <span class="MATH"><i>k</i></span> into a binary search tree <span class="MATH"><i>T</i></span> where <span class="MATH"><i>k</i></span> is 
different from those of existing keys in <span class="MATH"><i>T</i></span>, we first search the tree <span class="MATH"><i>T</i></span>. The search will be unsuccessful, then we insert the key at the 
point the search terminated. For instance, to insert a key 80 into the Figure 1(a), we first search the tree for 80. This search terminates 
unsuccessfully, and the last node examined has key 40. We insert a new node containing 80 as the right child of the node. The resulting 
search tree is shown in Figure 1(b). 

<p>
In this problem, we consider binary search trees with <span class="MATH"><i>N</i></span> keys 
<span class="MATH">1, 2,..., <i>N</i></span>. For a permutation 

<span class="MATH"><i>a</i><sub>1</sub>&nbsp;<i>a</i><sub>2</sub>&nbsp;...&nbsp;<i>a</i><sub>N</sub></span> of 
<span class="MATH">{1, 2,..., <i>N</i>}</span>, inserting 
<span class="MATH"><i>a</i><sub>1</sub>&nbsp;<i>a</i><sub>2</sub>&nbsp;...&nbsp;<i>a</i><sub>N</sub></span> successively into an initially empty binary 
search tree will produce a binary 
search tree. For instance, the permutation 2 1 4 3 5 will produce the tree in Figure 1(c). Also, 2 4 3 1 5 will produce the same tree. 
Actually, 8 permutations among all possible permutations of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 will produce the same tree to the tree in Figure 1(c).

<p>
We are interested in finding the number of permutations of 
<span class="MATH">{1, 2,..., <i>N</i>}</span> such that all those permutations produce a binary search 
tree identical to the tree produced by a given permutation <span class="MATH"><i>P</i></span>. Given <span class="MATH"><i>N</i></span> and <span class="MATH"><i>P</i></span>, you are to write a program that calculates the number of 
permutations satisfying the above condition.

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>
Your program is to read from standard input. The input consists of <span class="MATH"><i>T</i></span> test cases. 
The number of test cases <span class="MATH"><i>T</i></span> is given in the first line. Each test case starts with a line containing an integer <span class="MATH"><i>N</i></span> representing the number 
of keys, 
<span class="MATH">1<img width="18" height="31" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="4847img2.png" alt="$ \le$"><i>N</i><img width="18" height="31" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="4847img2.png" alt="$ \le$">20</span>. In the next line, a permutation of length <span class="MATH"><i>N</i></span> is given. There is a single space between the integers representing 
keys in the permutation.

Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>
Your program is to write to standard output. Print exactly one line for each test case as follows: 
Let <span class="MATH"><i>B</i></span> be the number of permutations that produce the binary search tree identical to the tree produced by the input permutation. 
Print 
<span class="MATH"><i>B</i> mod 9, 999, 991</span> for each test case. For example, if 
<span class="MATH"><i>B</i> = 20, 000, 000</span>, the output should be 18 for that test case.

<p>
The following shows sample input and output for three test cases.
