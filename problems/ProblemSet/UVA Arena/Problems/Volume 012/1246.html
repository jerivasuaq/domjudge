<h4 align="center">Time limit: 5 seconds</h4>
<hr>
<p>The Prime Minister and his Accumulated Council of Ministers(ACM) are trying hard to find all possible terrorist locations. In his dream, the Prime Minister gets a message from God suggesting that the answer to all terrorist problems are numbers(say one such number is X) such that the number of factors of X(including 1 and X) is prime. These numbers supposedly contain the encrypted locations of terrorists. Since the ACM has no programmer, the Prime Minister needs your help in finding out such numbers.</p>
<p>Note:- 1 is not considered a prime number .</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input will contain an integer T <= 20="" denoting="" the="" number="" of="" test=""></=><br> 
T lines follow, one per test case. <br> 
Each test case will be a line formatted as "L H" where L and H are integers and 0<><><=10000></=10000></p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output one line per case a space separated list of all integers(sorted ascending) lying between L and H(both inclusive) such that the number of factors of each integer is prime.In case no such integer exist output -1. </p>

<h2>Sample Output</h2>
