Bill and Scott are business rivals. Each of them wishes to buy
a house in Javaville, but they want to live as far away from
each other as possible. Since Javaville is a relatively new
town, there are no maps available yet; instead, information
about homes and other buildings has been collected by word of
mouth and provided to both Bill and Scott. This information
consists of building addresses and distances between
buildings. All of the information is consistent, although it may
be incomplete or redundant.

<p>
The streets in Javaville are laid out in a rectangular grid of <span class="MATH"><i>m</i></span>
east/west streets (named A, B, C, ...) and <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span> north/south streets
(numbered 0, 1, 2, ...), where <span class="MATH"><i>m</i></span> and <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span> are each between 2 and
10. Every building (either a house or some other building, such
as a post office or school) in Javaville is at the intersection of
two streets, and no two buildings are located at the same
intersection. Some intersections have no buildings at all. All
distances are measured in terms of the smallest number of
whole blocks that must be traversed north, south, east, and/or
west to get from one intersection to another intersection. It is
know that there are no more than 50 intersections in the entire
town.

<p>

<p>
<br>
Here is some sample information that might be provided to Bill and Scott by various reliable sources:

<p>

<ul>
<li>There are 5 east/west streets and 5 north/south streets.

<p>
</li>
<li>House1 is located at intersection A0

<p>
</li>
<li>The post office is located at intersection A4

<p>
</li>
<li>The school is at a distance of 4 blocks from house1

<p>
</li>
<li>House2 is at a distance of 6 blocks from the post office

<p>
</li>
<li>The school is at a distance of 6 blocks from the post office

<p>
</li>
<li>House3 is at a distance of 6 blocks from the post office
</li>
</ul>

<p>
From this we can see that there are two possible maps of Javaville-see Figure 1.

<p>

<p>
<br>
We see that the locations of house1, the post office, and the
school are fixed, but house2  could be at either C0 or E2, and
house3 could be at either C0 or E2. Clearly there is always a pair
of houses separated by 6 blocks (house1 is always 6 blocks from
the furthest house), but the best distance we can guarantee for
any <em>specific pair</em> of houses is 4 (since house2 is always 4 blocks
away from house 3). We would report this information to Bill and
Scott, telling them that, even though a separation of 6 is always
achievable, the safest recommendation that we are able to make for
specific houses is to have one of them purchase house2 and have
the other purchase house3. (We assume that Bill and Scott will
consult with one another before purchasing their houses in order
to guarantee that one of our recommendations is followed.)

<p>

<p>
<br>
Bill and Scott would like you to write a program that will take location and distance information about buildings and
determine two quantities, <span class="MATH"><i>D</i></span> and <span class="MATH"><i>D'</i></span>. <span class="MATH"><i>D</i></span> is the minimum, over all possible valid arrangements of buildings, of the
largest house separation in each arrangement. <span class="MATH"><i>D'</i></span> is the maximum value for which there exists a pair of houses <span class="MATH"><i>i</i></span> and
<span class="MATH"><i>j</i></span> that are guaranteed to be separated by a distance of at least <span class="MATH"><i>D'</i></span>. In the latter case, you should list all pairs
of houses that are guaranteed to be separated by at least <span class="MATH"><i>D'</i></span> blocks.

<p>
To make sure your program is working correctly, Bill and Scott would like to be able to test it on multiple data sets,
so your program will be presented with several hypothetical
descriptions of Javaville.

<p>

<h2><font size="4" color="#ff0000"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">
Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>
The input will consist of one or more descriptions. Each
description will begin with a line containing two positive
integers, <span class="MATH"><i>m</i></span> and <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span>, representing the number of blocks in each
direction (
<span class="MATH">2<img width="18" height="30" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="2108img1.gif" alt="$ \le$"><i>m</i>, <i>n</i><img width="18" height="30" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="2108img1.gif" alt="$ \le$">10</span>). Each description will end with a line
containing the single word `<tt>END</tt>' in uppercase. The entire data set
will end with a line containing a pair of zeros. No assignment of
values for <span class="MATH"><i>m</i></span> and <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span> will result in a town having more than 50
intersections.

<p>
The remaining lines in each data set will be in one of the
following two formats:

<p>

<p>
<br>

<tt><span class="MATH"><i>name</i></span> LOCATION <span class="MATH"><i>r</i></span> <span class="MATH"><i>c</i></span></tt>

<p>

<p>
<br>
or

<p>

<p>
<br>

<tt><span class="MATH"><i>name</i></span> DISTANCE <span class="MATH"><i>d</i></span> <span class="MATH"><i>name</i>2</span></tt>

<p>

<p>
<br>
where <span class="MATH"><i>name</i></span> and <span class="MATH"><i>name</i>2</span> are strings containing only digits and
lowercase alphabetic characters, each of length at most 10; <span class="MATH"><i>r</i></span> is
an uppercase letter between <tt>A</tt> and <tt>J</tt>; <span class="MATH"><i>c</i></span> is a digit; and <span class="MATH"><i>d</i></span> is a
positive integer. If the first five characters of a <span class="MATH"><i>name</i></span> are the
lowercase letters `<tt>house</tt>' then it is a candidate for selection as
a home for Bill or Scott; otherwise it stands for some
non-residential building. In a `<tt>DISTANCE</tt>' specification, <span class="MATH"><i>name</i>2</span>
will always be the name of some building that has occurred
previously in this data set as the first <span class="MATH"><i>name</i></span> on one of the data
lines (in other words, there are no forward references to
buildings in <tt>DISTANCE</tt> constraints). Each description is consistent
(i.e., there is at least one way to lay out the houses and other
buildings in a way consistent with the description). Each
description will include information about at least two distinct
houses. At most 20 distinct building names will occur in each
description, and there will be at most 21 constraints (<tt>LOCATION</tt> or
<tt>DISTANCE</tt>) for each description.

<p>

<h2><font size="4" color="#ff0000"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">
Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>
For each description, the output will consist of the description
number, followed by the maximum achievable house separation <span class="MATH"><i>D</i></span>,
followed by a list of all pairs of houses with maximum guaranteed
separation <span class="MATH"><i>D'</i></span> (which might be smaller than the maximum achievable
separation). No pair of houses should be listed more than once.
The output should be labeled exactly as shown in the sample output
below, with a blank line separating the outputs for consecutive
data sets. In each pair, houses should be ordered according to the
first time they appear in the input; the list of pairs should be
ordered in the same way, sorted by the first element of the pair,
then by the second element.
