<p>
Consider a closed world and a set of features that are defined for all the objects in the 
world. Each feature can be answered with ``yes" or ``no". Using those features, we can 
identify any object from the rest of the objects in the world. In other words, each object 
can be represented as a fixed-length sequence of booleans. Any object is different from 
other objects by at least one feature. 

<p>
You would like to identify an object from others. For this purpose, you can ask a series 
of questions to someone who knows what the object is. Every question you can ask is about 
one of the features. He/she immediately answers each question with ``yes" or ``no" 
correctly. You can choose the next question after you get the answer to the previous 
question. 

<p>
You kindly pay the answerer 100 yen as a tip for each question. Because you don't have 
surplus money, it is necessary to minimize the number of questions in the worst case. 
You don't know what is the correct answer, but fortunately know all the objects in the 
world. Therefore, you can plan an optimal strategy before you start questioning. 

<p>
The problem you have to solve is: given a set of boolean-encoded objects, minimize the 
maximum number of questions by which every object in the set is identifiable.

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>
The input is a sequence of multiple datasets. Each dataset begins with a line which 
consists of two integers, <span class="MATH"><i>m</i></span> and <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span>: the number of features, and the number of objects, 
respectively. You can assume 
<span class="MATH">0 &lt; <i>m</i><img width="18" height="31" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="4643img1.png" alt="$ \le$">11</span> and 
<span class="MATH">0 &lt; <i>n</i><img width="18" height="31" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="4643img1.png" alt="$ \le$">128</span>. It is followed by 
<span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span> lines, each of which corresponds to an object. Each line includes a binary string 
of length <span class="MATH"><i>m</i></span> which represent the value (``yes" or ``no") of features. There are no two 
identical objects. 

<p>
The end of the input is indicated by a line containing two zeros. There are at most 
100 datasets.

<p>
For each dataset, minimize the maximum number of questions by which every object is 
identifiable and output the result.
