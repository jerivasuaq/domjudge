By 2100, space travel will be a reality for the Milky Way (Solar Galaxy) residents. The 
Interstar Transport Travel agency operates scheduled direct space transports (flights) 
between some of the most popular planet destinations in the Milky Way. The cost of these 
scheduled direct transports are predetermined in Galaro (Galaxy Currency unit) and are 
published in many different languages. For travel to planets that is not on the schedule, 
there are slower, yet free, space flights from the closest planet that is on the direct 
transport list. To help travelers plan their itinerary, the Interstar Transport wants to 
offer a mobile application that can find the best traveling option, based on the total cost 
of the direct transports on the itinerary. Given the starting and destination planets on 
the itinerary, find the sequence of direct transports that has the lowest total traveling cost. 
Output all the planets in sequence that one must pass through on this best route. If two or 
more routes exist with the same cost, then the route that goes through the least number 
of intermediate planets is considered a better route. There will always exist a unique 
best route for any of the given test cases.

The first line of the input file contains two integers, <span class="MATH"><i>s</i></span> and <span class="MATH"><i>p</i></span>, separated by a space. The 
next <span class="MATH"><i>p</i></span> lines each contains two letters, <span class="MATH"><i>e</i><sub>i</sub></span> and <span class="MATH"><i>e</i><sub>j</sub></span>, followed by a natural number, 
<span class="MATH"><i>d</i><sub>ij</sub></span>, indicating that there exists a direct transport between planets <span class="MATH"><i>e</i><sub>i</sub></span> and <span class="MATH"><i>e</i><sub>j</sub></span> 
with a cost of <span class="MATH"><i>d</i><sub>ij</sub></span>. The next line contains an integer <span class="MATH"><i>n</i><img width="18" height="31" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="4524img1.png" alt="$ \le$">20</span>, indicating the number

For each of the <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span> queries in the input, output on one line the best route to take, in the 
sequence of starting planet, the intermediate planets in sequence along the route and the 
destination planet; all separated by one blank space.
