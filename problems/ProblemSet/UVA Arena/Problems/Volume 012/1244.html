In Ragannagar ( a small town in India), people are obsessed with palindromes . There are<strong> N </strong>road junctions(also callled points) labeled <strong>0</strong> to <strong>N-1</strong> and roads exist between every pair of points. Roads are onewayed and for the road connecting point <strong>i</strong> to point <strong>j</strong> ( <strong>i</strong> <><strong>j</strong>) the direction to travel is <strong>i</strong> to <strong>j.</strong> Each road is labeled with a letter between 'A' to 'Z' . Rajar ,the traveler, wants to travel from point <strong>0</strong> to point <strong>N-1</strong>. However he wants to cover the longest palindromic path.

</p><p>
In the above arrangement the possible paths to take are:- </p>
<ul>
<li> ACCA</li>
<li> ABA</li>
<li> ACB</li>
<li> BCA</li>
<li> AD</li>
<li> BB</li>
<li> AA</li>
<li> C</li>
</ul>
<p>
The largest palindrome amongst these is ACCA, so Rajar will take this path. Given the above configuration, help him decide which path to take.

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
The first line of input will contain an integer denoting the number of test cases<strong> T </strong><=25. each="" test="" case="" will="" be="" formatted="" as="" follows:-=""></=25.></p><ul>
<li>
The first line of each test case contains an integer denoting 2<=></=><strong>N</strong> <></li>
<li>
The next<strong> N </strong>lines contain<strong> N </strong>characters each. Each character is a letter
between 'A' to 'Z'. The jth character in the ith line denotes the label
for the road between i to j and this will be equal to the ith character
in the jth line.The ith character of the ith line will be * denoting no
road exists.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>Output one line per case - <br>
The longest palindromic path available or "NO PALINDROMIC PATH" if none exists.<i><strong>Note that quotes are for clarity only.</strong></i><br>
In case more than one longest path exists output the lexicographically smallest one.<br>
