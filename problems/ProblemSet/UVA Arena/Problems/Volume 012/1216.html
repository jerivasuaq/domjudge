<p>
Mr. Macdonald is a farmer. He has a huge land to manage. To monitor the number of bugs
in his land, he asks help from the famous professor T. Professor T is an expert on computer
science. 

<p>
Professor T studies several efficient approach and suggests Mr. Macdonald to setup a wireless 
sensor system in his land. The system will be setup as follows:

<p>
In each predened location, one wireless sensor will be established. Since all sensors are
operated by batteries, the powers consumed by the sensors are determined by the eective com-
munication distance (ECD) between sensors. Mr. Macdonald is a nice old man. He prefers not
to trouble professor T much. Therefore, he decides that all sensors will be set in the same power
level. That is, all sensors will have the same eective communication distance.

<p>
The land is so huge that it is not possible to cover all spots by the sensors. However, each
sensor can broadcast the collected data to their neighbors as long as the neighbors are in its
eective communication distance. But the total number of sensors is relative small comparing
to the land. Mr. Macdonald needs to travel the whole land to collect the data from sensors
everyday. 

<p>
Mr. Macdonald is getting old. He hopes that the computer in his house can collect all data
from all sensors automatically. Again, he called professor T for help. This time, professor T
suggests Mr. Macdonald to setup a base station in his house. The house is right in the center
of the land.

<p>
Due to the limited budget, the number of receiver/transmitter Mr. Macdonald can aord
is limited and is relatively small comparing to the total number of sensors. It is impossible
to assign receiver/transmitter to every sensor. Therefore, sensors with no receiver/transmitter
need to send their data to the sensor with receiver/transmitter (directly or indirect) rst, After
that, the sensor with receiver/transmitter sends all data it receives from other sensors along with
the data it collects back to the base station. You may assume that the receiver/transmitter has
enough power such that it always can send data back to the base station.

<p>
Professor T promises to write the necessary software to make all sensors work together in
this way, but one important issue need to be studied. If all sensors are set at the maximum
power level, all sensors might be able to send their data back without troubles, but the battery
will be out-of-power soon. To save power, professor T need to decide the minimum power level
needed such that the battery can have longest operating time while all sensor data can be col-
lected by the base station.

<p>
Although professor T is good in programming, he is weak in algorithm design. Your goal
is to help professor T to write a program to determine the minimum power level needed to set
all sensors accordingly. To simplify our problem, please report the ECD corresponding to the
minimum power level. Please apply the ceiling function to your answer.

<p>
Here is an example:

<p>
Assume that the land is 
<span class="MATH">10&#215;10</span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>. There are three sensors, located at (1,1), (2,1) and (8,7).
We also assume that there are 2 receiver/transmitters. In this example, the ECD of all sensors
need to be set at 1.

<p>
The first line contains the number of test cases <span class="MATH"><i>w</i></span>

Then the <span class="MATH"><i>w</i></span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> test cases are
listed one by one. In each test case, the first line is a single integer, representing the number of
receiver/transmitters for that test case. After that, the test case consists of some lines with two
numbers each line:

<p>

<p>
<br>

<span class="MATH"><i>X</i>&nbsp;<i>Y</i></span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>

<p>

<p>
<br>
Here two numbers are separated by a single blank, <span class="MATH"><i>X</i></span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> is an integer, denoting the x-coordinate
of the sensor, and <span class="MATH"><i>Y</i></span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> is also an integer, denoting the y-coordinate of the same sensor. Each test
case is ended by the following line: `<tt>-1</tt>'

<p>
Please note that the land is a rectangle with dimemsions
