      <p>Every customer sometimes needs help with new and unusual products. 
      Therefore, hotline service is very important for every company. We need 
      a&nbsp;single phone number where the customer can always find 
      a&nbsp;friendly voice ready to help with anything. On the other hand, many 
      people are needed to serve as hotline operators, and human resources are 
      always very expensive. Moreover, it is not easy to pretend "friendly 
      voice" at 4am and explain to a&nbsp;drunken man that you are really unable 
      to give him the number to House of Parliament. It was also found that some 
      of the questions repeat very often and it is very annoying to answer them 
      again and again. 
      <p>ACM is a&nbsp;modern company, wanting to solve its hotline problem. 
      They want to decrease the number of human operators by creating 
      a&nbsp;complex software system that would be able to answer most common 
      questions. The customer's voice is analysed by a&nbsp;special Voice 
      Recognition Module (VRM) and converted to a&nbsp;plain text. The text is 
      then taken by an Artificial Automatic Adaptive Answering Algorithm 
      (AAAAA). The most common questions are recognised and answered 
      automatically. The replies are then converted to a&nbsp;sound by 
      Text-to-Speech Module (TTS). 
      <p>You are to write the AAAAA module. Because your algorithm should be 
      adaptive, it has no explicit knowledge base. But it must be able to listen 
      to sentences in English and remember the mentioned facts. Whenever the 
      question is asked about such a&nbsp;fact, the system has to answer it 
      properly. The VRM and TTS modules are already implemented, so the input 
      and output of AAAAA will be in the text form.

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>


      <p>There is a&nbsp;single positive integer <var>T</var> on the first line 
      of input. It stands for the number of dialogues to follow. Each dialogue 
      consists of zero or more lines, each of them containing one sentence: 
      either statement or question. The statement ends with a&nbsp;dot character 
      (<tt>.</tt>), the question ends with a&nbsp;question mark (<tt>?</tt>). No 
      statement will appear more than once, however the questions can be 
      repeated. There is one extra line after each dialogue. That line ends with 
      an&nbsp;exclamation mark (<tt>!</tt>). 
      <p>Sentences can contain words, spaces and punctuation characters (such as 
      commas, colons, semicolons etc.). All words contain only letters of 
      English alphabet and are case-sensitive. That means the same word is 
      always written the same way, usually in lowercase. Acronyms, names and 
      some other words can begin with capital letters. For simplicity, all 
      sentences begin with a&nbsp;lowercase letter. Only if the first word 
      should be written with a&nbsp;capital, the sentence begins with 
      a&nbsp;capital letter. There are no unneeded spaces between words. No line 
      will have more than 100 characters. There will be at most 100 statements 
      per each test case. 
      <p>
      <h3>Statements</h3>
      <p>Each statement has one of the following two forms ( 
      <img src="p2160.gif" width="12" height="6"> denotes a&nbsp;space): <br><i>subject</i>
	  <img src="p2160.gif" width="12" height="6"> <i>predicate</i>[<tt>s</tt>] [
      <img src="p2160.gif" width="12" height="6"> <i>object</i>] <tt>.</tt>
      <br><i>subject</i> 
	  <img src="p2160.gif" width="12" height="6">
      <tt>don't</tt>|<tt>doesn't</tt> 
	  <img src="p2160.gif" width="12" height="6">
      <i>predicate</i> [ 
	  <img src="p2160.gif" width="12" height="6"> <i>object</i>]
      <tt>.</tt> 
      <p>The square brackets mark an&nbsp;optional part, the vertical line two 
      possible variants. Subject is a&nbsp;single word, noun or pronoun in 
      singular. Predicate is a&nbsp;verb (single word) denoting some activity. 
      Object can be any text. Object does not contain any dots. Any pair "verb + 
      object" determines unique activity. The same verb with different objects 
      makes different independent activities, i.e. the different and independent 
      meaning of the sentence. Sentence without any object can be considered as 
      sentence with an&nbsp;empty object. The verb without an&nbsp;object has 
      different and independent meaning than the same verb with any non-empty 
      object. 
      <p>The first variant of sentence denotes a&nbsp;positive statement. The 
      word "<i>predicate</i>[<tt>s</tt>]" means verb that matches the subject of 
      the sentence. If the subject is "<tt>I</tt>" or "<tt>you</tt>", the verb 
      has the same form as the infinitive. With any other subject, the letter 
      "<tt>s</tt>" is appended on the end of the verb. Assume there are no 
      irregular verbs. 
      <p>The second variant is a&nbsp;negative statement. Verb "<tt>don't</tt>" 
      or "<tt>doesn't</tt>" must also match the subject. The form 
      "<tt>don't</tt>" is used with either "<tt>I</tt>" or "<tt>you</tt>", 
      "<tt>doesn't</tt>" is used in any other case. 
      <p>A&nbsp;special generic subject "<tt>everybody</tt>" can be used. It 
      means the activity holds for any subject. Other special subject is 
      "<tt>nobody</tt>". Such sentence also holds for any subject, but its 
      meaning is negative. Both of these generic subjects can be used with the 
      first variant only (without "<tt>doesn't</tt>"). The sentence "<tt>nobody 
      likes something</tt>" is exactly equal to "<tt>everybody doesn't like 
      something</tt>", except the latter form will never occur in the input. 
      <p>
      <h3>Questions</h3>
      <p>Each question has one of the following three forms: 
      <dl compact="">
        <dt>1. 
        <dd><tt>do</tt>|<tt>does</tt> 
		<img src="p2160.gif" width="12" height="6">
        <i>subject</i> 
		<img src="p2160.gif" width="12" height="6"> <i>predicate</i> [
		<img src="p2160.gif" width="12" height="6"> object] <tt>?</tt>
        <dt>2. 
        <dd><tt>who</tt> 
		<img src="p2160.gif" width="12" height="6">
        <i>predicate</i><tt>s</tt> [ 
		<img src="p2160.gif" width="12" height="6">
        <i>object</i>] <tt>?</tt> 
        <dt>3. 
        <dd><tt>what</tt> 
		<img src="p2160.gif" width="12" height="6">
        <tt>do</tt>|<tt>does</tt> 
		<img src="p2160.gif" width="12" height="6">
        <i>subject</i> <tt>do</tt> <tt>?</tt> </dd></dt></dd></dt></dd></dt></dl>
      <p>The word "<tt>do</tt>|<tt>does</tt>" always matches the subject 
      ("<tt>do I?</tt>", "<tt>do you?</tt>", "<tt>does</tt> any other 
      subject?"). In the second type of question, predicate always matches the 
      word "<tt>who</tt>", i.e. the "<tt>s</tt>" is always appended. Generic 
      subjects cannot be used in questions.

<h2><font size="4" color="#ff0000"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">
Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

      <p>For each dialogue, your program must output the line <tt>Dialogue 
      #</tt><var>D</var><tt>:</tt>, where <var>D</var> is the sequence number of 
      dialogue, starting with 1. Then print exactly three lines for every 
      question: the first line repeats the question, the second line contains 
      the answer, and the third line is empty. Print nothing for statements. 
      After each dialogue, print the same line with an&nbsp;exclamation mark 
      that was in the input. Then print one extra empty line. Empty line 
      contains a&nbsp;new-line character only. 
      <p>The answer must be properly formated to be accepted by a&nbsp;TTS 
      module. Only the statements appearing in the input before the answer are 
      used for the corresponding reply. If there is any contradiction among 
      statements, the reply is always <tt>I am abroad.</tt>. If the question and 
      statements consider the special subject "<tt>you</tt>", it must be 
      replaced with "<tt>I</tt>" in the answer. If the question considers 
      special subject "<tt>I</tt>", it must be replaced with "<tt>you</tt>" in 
      the answer. The verb must always match the subject of the sentence. The 
      exact form of the correct answer depends on the type of question. 
      <p>
      <h3>1.&nbsp;does subject predicate [object] ?</h3>
      <p>If there is any positive statement about the mentioned subject (or 
      generic subject "<tt>everybody</tt>"), predicate and object, the answer 
      is: <br><tt>yes,</tt> 
	  <img src="p2160.gif" width="12" height="6"> <i>subject</i>
	  <img src="p2160.gif" width="12" height="6"> <i>predicate</i>[<tt>s</tt>] [
      <img src="p2160.gif" width="12" height="6"> <i>object</i>] <tt>.</tt>
      <p>If there is any negative statement about the mentioned subject (or 
      generic subject "<tt>nobody</tt>"), predicate and object, the answer is: 
      <br><tt>no,</tt> 
	  <img src="p2160.gif" width="12" height="6"> <i>subject</i>
      <img src="p2160.gif" width="12" height="6"> <tt>don't</tt>|<tt>doesn't</tt>
      <img src="p2160.gif" width="12" height="6"> <i>predicate</i> [
      <img src="p2160.gif" width="12" height="6"> <i>object</i>] <tt>.</tt>
      <p>Otherwise, the answer is: <tt>maybe.</tt> 
      <p>Subject in the answer is always the same subject as the subject of the 
      question. 
      <p>
      <h3>2.&nbsp;who predicates [object] ?</h3>
      <p>If there is a&nbsp;positive statement considering any subject, the 
      specified predicate and object, the answer is: <br><i>subject</i> 
      <img src="p2160.gif" width="12" height="6"> <i>predicate</i>[<tt>s</tt>] [
      <img src="p2160.gif" width="12" height="6"> <i>object</i>] <tt>.</tt>
      <p>If two or more subjects match the activity, replace the subject in the 
      answer with enumeration of all such subjects, in the same order as the 
      corresponding statements have appeared in the input. Subjects are 
      separated with comma and space, last two subjects are separated with the 
      word "<tt>and</tt>". If "<tt>everybody</tt>" belongs to the group of 
      enumerated subjects, do not enumerate subjects, and print 
      "<tt>everybody</tt>" only. If the enumeration contains at least two 
      subjects, the predicate matches the plural subject (i.e. verb is without 
      trailing "<tt>s</tt>"), otherwise it matches the only subject. 
      <br><i>subject1</i> <tt>,</tt> 
	  <img src="p2160.gif" width="12" height="6">
	  <i>subject2</i> <img src="p2160.gif" width="12" height="6"> <tt>and</tt>
      <img src="p2160.gif" width="12" height="6"> <i>subject3</i> <i>predicate</i> [
      <img src="p2160.gif" width="12" height="6"> <i>object</i>] <tt>.</tt>
      <p>If there is a&nbsp;negative statement considering the generic subject 
      "nobody", the specified predicate and object, the answer is: 
      <br><i>nobody</i> 
	  <img src="p2160.gif" width="12" height="6">
      <i>predicate</i><tt>s</tt> [ 
	  <img src="p2160.gif" width="12" height="6">
      <i>object</i>] <tt>.</tt> 
      <p>Otherwise, the answer is: <tt>I don't know.</tt> 
      <p>
      <h3>3.&nbsp;what does subject do ?</h3>
      <p>If there are one or more sentences (both positive and negative) 
      considering the specified subject (or a&nbsp;generic subject 
      "<tt>everybody</tt>" or "<tt>nobody</tt>"), all verbs and objects from 
      such sentences must be included in a&nbsp;reply in the same order as the 
      corresponding sentences have appeared in the input. No verb-object pair 
      can be included more than once (the eventual second appearance must be 
      skipped). The verb-object pairs are separated by a&nbsp;comma followed by 
      a&nbsp;space, the last verb is separated by a&nbsp;comma and the word 
      "<tt>and</tt>". Please note the comma is printed here although there was 
      no comma when separating the subjects in the previous type of answer (see 
      above). The negative answers have the same form as the statements, that 
      means the verb "<tt>don't</tt>" or "<tt>doesn't</tt>" is used: 
      <br><i>subject</i> [ 
	  <img src="p2160.gif" width="12" height="6">
      <tt>don't</tt>|<tt>doesn't</tt>]
