<p>
A factory produces products as follows. There are <span class="MATH"><i>N</i></span> days in the coming production season. 
Each morning the factory orders materials. At noon the materials will arrive and shipped 
into a warehouse. In the afternoon the factory produces products using the material in 
the warehouse. There is only one kind of material and one kind of product, and one unit 
of materials can make one unit of product. The factory needs to produce exactly <span class="MATH"><i>d</i><sub>i</sub></span> 
products on the <span class="MATH"><i>i</i></span>-th day of the production season, where <span class="MATH"><i>i</i></span> is between 1 and <span class="MATH"><i>N</i></span>. Also if 
the factory does not use all the materials in the warehouse, it can use them later, but 
the material can only be stored in the warehouse for up to 2 days, after that they cannot 
be used to make products. That is, if a material was shipped to the factory on the <span class="MATH"><i>i</i></span>-th 
day, it can be used only on the <span class="MATH"><i>i</i></span>-th and <span class="MATH"><i>i</i> + 1</span>-th day. 

<p>
We want to order materials for this factory with minimum cost. Let <span class="MATH"><i>p</i><sub>i</sub></span> be the price of 
material on the <span class="MATH"><i>i</i></span>-th day and <span class="MATH"><i>n</i><sub>i</sub></span> be the maximum number of units of material one can order 
on the <span class="MATH"><i>i</i></span>-th day. Both <span class="MATH"><i>p</i><sub>i</sub></span> and <span class="MATH"><i>n</i><sub>i</sub></span> are changing daily. Note that we may want to 
order more materials when they are cheap, but keep in mind that we can order at most <span class="MATH"><i>n</i><sub>i</sub></span> 
units on the <span class="MATH"><i>i</i></span>-th day, and we must use the materials within two days after we order them. 
Fortunately, the warehouse is large enough to store all materials for the entire 
production season, so we do not need to worry about its capacity. Instead we only need 
to determine the amount of materials to order for each day, so that we can produce <span class="MATH"><i>d</i><sub>i</sub></span> 
products on the <span class="MATH"><i>i</i></span>-th day, and the entire material cost is minimized.

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2> 

<p>
The first line of the input file contains an integer indicating the number of test cases to 
follow. The first line of the test case has the number of days (<span class="MATH"><i>N</i></span>) in the production 
season. Each of the next <span class="MATH"><i>N</i></span> lines has the price of material per unit (<span class="MATH"><i>p</i><sub>i</sub></span>), the maximum 
number of units of material (<span class="MATH"><i>n</i><sub>i</sub></span>) the factory can order, and the amount of materials (<span class="MATH"><i>d</i><sub>i</sub></span>) 
ordered for that day.

<p>
For each test case, output the minimum material cost to produce all products. It is 
assumed that there exists a solution.
