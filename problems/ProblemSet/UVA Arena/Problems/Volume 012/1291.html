Mr. White, a fat man, now is crazy about a game named ``Dance, Dance, Revolution".  But his 
dance skill is so poor that he could not dance a dance, even if he dances arduously every time.  
Does ``DDR" just mean him a perfect method to squander his pounds?  No way.  He still 
expects that he will be regarded as ``Terpsichorean White" one day.  So he is considering writing 
a program to plan the movement sequence of his feet, so that he may save his strength on dancing.  
Now he looks forward to dancing easily instead of sweatily. 

<p>
``DDR" is a dancing game that requires the dancer to use his feet to tread on the points according 
to the direction sequence in the game.  There are one central point and four side  points in the 
game.  Those side points are classified as top, left, bottom and right.  For the sake of 
explanation, we mark them integers.  That is, the central point is 0, the top is 1, the left is 2, the 
bottom is 3, and the right is 4, as the figure below shows: 

<p>
<div align="CENTER">

<img width="218" height="227" align="BOTTOM" border="0" src="2031img1.png" alt="\epsfbox{p2031.eps}">
</div>

<p>
At the beginning the dancer's two feet stay on the central point.  According to the direction 
sequence, the dancer has to move one of his feet to the special points.  For example, if the 
sequence requires him to move to the top point at first, he may move either of his feet from point 0 
to point 1 (<span class="textit">Note: Not both of his feet</span>).  Also, if the sequence then requires him to move to the 
bottom point, he may move either of his feet to point 3, regardless whether to use the foot that 
stays on point 0 or the one that stays on point 1. 

<p>
There is a strange rule in the game: moving both of his feet to the same point is not allowed.  For 
instance, if the sequence requires the dancer to the bottom point and one of his feet already sta ys 
on point 3, he should stay the very foot on the same point and tread again, instead of moving the 
other one to point 3. 

<p>
After dancing for a long time, Mr. White can calculate how much strength will be consumed when 
he moves from one point to another.  Moving one of his feet from the central point to any side 
points will consume 2 units of his strength.  Moving from one side point to another adjacent side 
point will consume 3 units, such as from the top point to the left point.  Moving from one side 
point to the opposite side point will consume 4 units, such as from the top point to the bottom 
point.  Yet, if he stays on the same point and tread again, he will use 1 unit. 

<p>
Assume that the sequence requires Mr. White to move to point 
<span class="MATH">1 <img width="22" height="17" align="BOTTOM" border="0" src="2031img2.png" alt="$ \rightarrow$"> 2 <img width="22" height="17" align="BOTTOM" border="0" src="2031img2.png" alt="$ \rightarrow$"> 2 <img width="22" height="17" align="BOTTOM" border="0" src="2031img2.png" alt="$ \rightarrow$"> 4</span>.  His feet may 
stays on (point 0, point 0)
<span class="MATH"><img width="22" height="17" align="BOTTOM" border="0" src="2031img2.png" alt="$ \rightarrow$"> (0, 1) <img width="22" height="17" align="BOTTOM" border="0" src="2031img2.png" alt="$ \rightarrow$"> (2, 1) <img width="22" height="17" align="BOTTOM" border="0" src="2031img2.png" alt="$ \rightarrow$"> (2, 1) <img width="22" height="17" align="BOTTOM" border="0" src="2031img2.png" alt="$ \rightarrow$"> (2, 4)</span>.  In this couple of integers, the  former number represents the point of his left foot, and the latter represents the point of his right foot.  In this way, he has to consume 8 units of his strength.  If he tries another pas, he will have 
to consume much more strength.  The 8 units of strength is the least cost.

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2> 

<p>
The input file will consist of a series of direction sequences.  Each direction sequence contains a 
sequence of numbers.  Ea ch number should either be 1, 2, 3, or 4, and each represents one of the 
four directions.  A value of 0 in the direction sequence indicates the end of direction sequence.  
And this value should be excluded from the direction sequence.  The input file ends  if the 
sequence contains a single 0.

Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2> 

<p>
For each direction sequence, print the least units of strength will be consumed.  The result should 
be a single integer on a line by itself.  Any more white spaces or blank lines are not allowable.
