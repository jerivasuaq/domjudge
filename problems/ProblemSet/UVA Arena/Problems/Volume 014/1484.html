<p>
Alice and Bob are going on a trip. Alice is a lazy girl who wants to minimize the total 
travelling distance, while Bob as an active boy wants to maximize it. At the same time, 
they cannot let the value to be less than a given integer <span class="MATH"><i>L</i></span> since that will make them 
miss too much pleasure, and they cannot let the value to be greater than a given integer 
<span class="MATH"><i>R</i></span> since they don't want to get too exhausted. 

<p>
The city they are visiting has <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span> spots and the spots are connected by directed edges. 
The spots are connected in such a way that 
they form a tree and the root will always be at spot 0. They take turns to select which 
edge to go. Both of them choose optimally. Bob will go first.

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>
There are multiple test cases. For every test case, the first line has three integers, 
<span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span>, <span class="MATH"><i>L</i></span> and <span class="MATH"><i>R</i></span> 
<span class="MATH">(1<img width="18" height="31" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="5088img1.png" alt="$ \le$"><i>n</i><img width="18" height="31" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="5088img1.png" alt="$ \le$">500000, 0<img width="18" height="31" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="5088img1.png" alt="$ \le$"><i>L</i>, <i>R</i><img width="18" height="31" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="5088img1.png" alt="$ \le$">1000000000)</span>. The next <span class="MATH"><i>n</i> - 1</span> lines 
each has three integers <span class="MATH"><i>a</i></span>, <span class="MATH"><i>b</i></span> and <span class="MATH"><i>c</i></span>, indicating that there is an edge going from 
spot <span class="MATH"><i>a</i></span> to spot <span class="MATH"><i>b</i></span> with length <span class="MATH"><i>c</i></span> 
<span class="MATH">(1<img width="18" height="31" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="5088img1.png" alt="$ \le$"><i>c</i><img width="18" height="31" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="5088img1.png" alt="$ \le$">1000)</span>. The spots are labeled from 0 
to <span class="MATH"><i>n</i> - 1</span>. 

<p>
There is a blank line after each test case.

<p>
If the total distance is not within the range <span class="MATH">[<i>L</i>, <i>R</i>]</span>, print "<tt>Oh, my god!</tt>" on a 
single line. Otherwise, print the most value Bob can get.
