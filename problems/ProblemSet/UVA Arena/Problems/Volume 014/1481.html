Xi, a developmental biologist is working on developmental distances 
of chromosomes. A chromosome, in the Xi's simplistic view, is a 
permutation from <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span> genes numbered 1 to <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span>. Xi is working on an 
evolutionary distance metric between two chromosomes. In Xi's theory 
of evolution any subset of genes lying together in both chromosomes 
is a positive witness for chromosomes to be similar. 

<p>
A positive witness is a pair of sequence of the same length <span class="MATH"><i>A</i></span> and <span class="MATH"><i>A'</i></span>, 
where <span class="MATH"><i>A</i></span> is a consecutive subsequence of the first chromosome, <span class="MATH"><i>A'</i></span> is a 
consecutive subsequence of the second chromosome, and <span class="MATH"><i>A</i></span> is a 
permutation of <span class="MATH"><i>A'</i></span>. The goal is to count the number of positive 
witnesses of two given chromosomes that have a length greater than one.

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2> 

<p>
There are several test case in the input. Each test case starts 
with a line containing the number of genes 
<span class="MATH">(2<img width="18" height="31" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="5052img1.png" alt="$ \le$"><i>n</i><img width="18" height="31" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="5052img1.png" alt="$ \le$">3000)</span>. 
The next two lines contain the two chromosomes, each as a list of 
positive integers. The input terminates with a line containing 
``<tt>0</tt>'' which should not be processed as a test case.

Output</a>&nbsp;</font>

<p>
For each test case, output a single line containing the number of 
positive witness for two chromosomes to be similar.
