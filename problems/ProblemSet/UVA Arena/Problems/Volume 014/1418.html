<p>
The <span class="textit">Brasileiro League</span> is the most important event in Brazil. There are <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> football teams participating in the competitions, each team plays twice (home and away) against each other team. Each team receives three points for a win and one point for a draw. No point is awarded for a loss. 

<p>
When the games are finished, teams are ranked by numbers from 1 to <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> according to the total points. The rank of each team <span class="MATH"><i>t</i></span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> having <span class="MATH"><i>p</i></span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> points is one plus the number of teams having more than <span class="MATH"><i>p</i></span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> points. It is possible that more than one team have the same ranks. 

<p>
In addition to the Champion (the first ranked team or teams), the <span class="textit">WonderTeam</span> is also awarded, if there exists one. The team that has absolutely the highest number of wins (absolutely means no other teams has the same number of wins), absolutely the highest number of goals scored, and absolutely the lowest number of goals conceded, is called the WonderTeam. (WonderTeam should have all these properties.) 

<p>
Your task is to find out the worst possible rank for the WonderTeam.

<p>
There are multiple test cases in the input. Each test case consists of only one line containing <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span>

<span class="MATH">(1<img width="18" height="31" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="4094img1.png" alt="$ \le$"><i>n</i><img width="18" height="31" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="4094img1.png" alt="$ \le$">50)</span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, the number of teams in league. The input terminates with a line containing `<tt>0</tt>'.
