<p>
There is a piece of grids land of size 
<span class="MATH"><i>n</i> <tt>x</tt> <i>m</i></span>. Chandler and his 
team take responsibility to guard it. There are some searchlights on 
some pieces and each of them has a capability to lighten a distance 
towards four directions: north, south, east and west. Different 
searchlight has different lightening capability shown in levels. 
Searchlight with level <span class="MATH"><i>k</i></span> means that it can lighten <span class="MATH"><i>k</i></span> grids (including 
the gird that the searchlight stands in) along any of the four 
directions. Shown in following figure, there is a searchlight of 
level 3 and the shadow grids are ones that can be lightened by it. 
Particularly, searchlight of level 1 means that it can only lighten the 
grid in which the searchlight stands.

<div align="CENTER">Figure: A searchlight of Level 3

</div>

<p>
Each searchlight has a maximum level. You can decrease a searchlight's 
level to save the energy. A searchlight whose maximum level is <span class="MATH"><i>k</i></span> can be 
turned to level <span class="MATH"><i>k</i></span>, <span class="MATH"><i>k</i> - 1</span>, <span class="MATH"><i>k</i> - 2</span>, <span class="MATH">...</span>, 1 and 0. Level 0 means 
turning off the searchlight. 

<p>
A grid is well-guarded if and only if <span class="textbf">at least</span> one of the 
following two conditions is satisfied: 

<p>

<ol>
<li>There is a searchlight in this grid, and it is not switched to 
level 0 (the light is on). 
</li>
<li>The grid is lightened by <span class="textbf">at least</span> two searchlights. One lightens 
it in horizontal direction (east or west), and another lightens it in 
vertical direction (north or south). 
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Chandler asks you to help finding 
a solution that he can turn on some of the searchlights so that:

<ol>
<li>All the grids are well-guarded. 
</li>
<li>All the searchlights turned on are in a same level. 
</li>
<li>That same level mentioned above is as small as possible. 
</li>
</ol>

<p>
More specifically, if you choose a same level <span class="MATH"><i>Q</i></span>, then all the 
searchlights whose maximum level are less than <span class="MATH"><i>Q</i></span> have to be turned off. 
Please help him to find a solution with the minimum same level.

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>
The input file contains several test cases. 

<p>
For each test case, the first 
line is two integers <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span> and <span class="MATH"><i>m</i></span>, representing a grids land of size 

<span class="MATH"><i>n</i> <tt>x</tt> <i>m</i></span>. 
<span class="MATH">(0 &lt; <i>n</i><img width="18" height="31" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="4841img2.png" alt="$ \le$">100, 0 &lt; <i>m</i><img width="18" height="31" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="4841img2.png" alt="$ \le$">10000)</span>. Following <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span> lines describe 
an 
<span class="MATH"><i>n</i> <tt>x</tt> <i>m</i></span> matrix in which <span class="MATH"><i>a</i><sub>i, j</sub></span> means the maximum level of the 
searchlight in grid <span class="MATH">(<i>i</i>, <i>j</i>)</span>. <span class="MATH"><i>a</i><sub>i, j</sub></span> can be zero, which means there 
is no searchlight on that grid. For all the cases, 
<span class="MATH"><i>a</i><sub>i, j</sub><img width="18" height="31" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="4841img2.png" alt="$ \le$">10000</span>. 

<p>
The input file ends with a line containing two zeros.
