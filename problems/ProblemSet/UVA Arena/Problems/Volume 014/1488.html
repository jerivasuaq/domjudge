On the planet Pandora, huge rocks are floating in the sky. Despite the 
beautiful scenery, these rocks bring some critical problem: they block 
the sunshine, and shade on the ground. Na'vi (``people" living on the 
planet) cannot grow plants in the shade because of the lack of sunshine. 
In order to predicate the amount of food they can get, they have to 
calculate the area of the shade. 

<p>
Let's assume the ``sun" as a point-source of light, and the ground as a 
infinite flat plane. Also, to simplify this problem, assume all rocks 
are convex polyhedrons. 

<p>
Now here is a mathematical problem. Given the position of the point-source 
of light, the position of a convex polyhedron and the position of an 
infinite plane, you are required to calculate the area of the shade. 
Please note that light travels in a strictly straight line and the 
light source and the convex polyhedron are on the same side of the plane. 
The light source is not placed in the convex polyhedron, nor on the 
polyhedron or on the plane.

three float numbers, indicating the position of a point which is a vertex

which means the position of the point-source of light.

<p>
For each case, if there is no shade on the plane, print ``<tt>0.00</tt>". 

<p>
If the area of the shade is infinite, print ``<tt>Infi</tt>". 

<p>
Otherwise, print out the area of the shade. Please round the result to 
two digits after the decimal point.

<span class="textbf">Hint:</span>
Here are some hints to help you implement rotation in 3-dimensional 
space. 

<p>

<ul>
<li>Assume that there is a plane 
<span class="MATH"><i>ax</i> + <i>by</i> + <i>cz</i> = 0</span>, and our task is to 
rotate the whole space so that the plane will be in the position <span class="MATH"><i>z</i> = 0</span>. 

<p>
As we all know, the normal vector of the plane is <span class="MATH">(<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>)</span> , so after 
we rotate the space, the normal vector will be the z-axis. So we can only 
consider how to rotate the vector to the position 

<span class="MATH">(0, 0,<img width="108" height="42" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="5100img1.png" alt="$ \sqrt{{a^{2} + b^{2} + c^{2}}}$">)</span>. 

<p>
</li>
<li>We can divide the process into 2 steps. First step, rotate the normal 
vector to 
<span class="MATH">(0,<img width="72" height="42" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="5100img2.png" alt="$ \sqrt{{a^{2} + b^{2}}}$">, <i>c</i>)</span>. Second step, rotate 

<span class="MATH">(0,<img width="72" height="42" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="5100img2.png" alt="$ \sqrt{{a^{2} + b^{2}}}$">, <i>c</i>)</span> to 
<span class="MATH">(0, 0,<img width="108" height="42" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="5100img1.png" alt="$ \sqrt{{a^{2} + b^{2} + c^{2}}}$">)</span>. 
Then apply the two rotation steps on the whole space, we can rotate the 
plane to a given position. 

<p>
It is easy to implement the two steps. In first step, the third number 
in the normal vector does not change, so this is like rotation in a 
2-dimensional space. Similarly, we implement the second step.
</li>
</ul>
