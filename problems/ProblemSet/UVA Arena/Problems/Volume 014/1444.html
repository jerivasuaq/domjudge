<p>
You are in a library equipped with bookracks that move on rails. There are many 
parallel rails, i.e., the bookracks are organized in several rows, see figure:

<p>
<div align="CENTER">

<img width="455" height="385" align="BOTTOM" border="0" src="p4629a.png" alt="\epsfbox{p4629a.eps}">
</div>
<p>
<div align="CENTER">The boockracks in the library. There is no passage to the librarian at the moment.

</div>

<p>
To borrow a book, you have to find the librarian, who seems to hide on the opposite side 
of the bookracks. Your task then is to move the racks along the rails so that a passage 
forms. Each rack has a certain integer width, and can be safely positioned at any 
integer point along the rail. (A rack does not block in a non-integer position and could 
accidentally move in either direction). The racks in a single row need not be contiguous 
-- there can be arbitrary (though integer) space between two successive bookracks. A 
passage is formed at position <span class="MATH"><i>k</i></span> if there is no bookrack in the interval 
<span class="MATH">(<i>k</i>, <i>k</i> + 1)</span> in 
any row (somehow you don't like the idea of trying to find a more sophisticated passage 
in this maze.)

<img width="999" height="385" align="BOTTOM" border="0" src="p4629b.png" alt="\epsfbox{p4629b.eps}">
</div>
<p>
<div align="CENTER">The passages formed in the library: at position 8 (the left figure) and at 
position 9 (the right figure). Both attained at cost 3 by moving the bookracks marked 
with arrows.

</div>

<p>
Moving a rack requires a certain amount of efflort on your part: moving it in either 
direction costs 1. This cost does not depend on the distance of the shift, which 
can be explained by a well known fact that static friction is considerably higher 
than kinetic friction. Still, you are here to borrow a book, not to work out, so 
you would like to form a passage (at any position) with as little efflort as possible.

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
The input contains several test cases. The first line of the input contains a positive 
integer <span class="MATH"><i>Z</i><img width="18" height="31" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="4629img3.png" alt="$ \le$">15</span>, denoting the number of test cases. Then <span class="MATH"><i>Z</i></span> test cases follow, each 
conforming to the format described below.

<p>

<p>
<br>
Two space separated integers <span class="MATH"><i>R</i></span> and <span class="MATH"><i>L</i></span> 
<span class="MATH">(1<img width="18" height="31" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="4629img3.png" alt="$ \le$"><i>R</i>, 1<img width="18" height="31" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="4629img3.png" alt="$ \le$"><i>L</i><img width="18" height="31" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="4629img3.png" alt="$ \le$">10<sup>6</sup>)</span> are given in the 
first line of an input instance. They denote the number of rows and the width of each and 
every row, respectively. Then <span class="MATH"><i>R</i></span> lines with rows descriptions follow. Each such line starts 
with an integer <span class="MATH"><i>n</i><sub>i</sub></span>, followed by <span class="MATH"><i>n</i><sub>i</sub></span> integers 
<span class="MATH"><i>a</i><sub>i, 1</sub>, <i>a</i><sub>i, 2</sub>,...<i>a</i><sub>i, n<sub>i</sub></sub></span>, all 
separated by single spaces. Number <span class="MATH"><i>a</i><sub>i, j</sub></span> denotes either the width of a bookrack when 

<span class="MATH"><i>a</i><sub>i, j</sub> &gt; 0</span> or a unit of empty space when 
<span class="MATH"><i>a</i><sub>i, j</sub> = 0</span>. Note that for any row 

<span class="MATH"><i>i</i>,<img width="28" height="33" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="4629img4.png" alt="$ \sum_{{j}}^{}$"><i>a</i><sub>i, j</sub></span> equals <span class="MATH"><i>L</i></span> minus the number of <span class="MATH"><i>a</i><sub>i, j</sub></span> that are equal to zero. You may 
assume that 
<span class="MATH"><i>n</i><sub>1</sub> + <i>n</i><sub>2</sub> + <sup> ... </sup> + <i>n</i><sub>R</sub><img width="18" height="31" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="4629img3.png" alt="$ \le$">2*10<sup>7</sup></span>. Moreover, 
there will be at least one 0 in the description of each row, which means that creating a 
passage is always possible.

Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
For each test case, your program 
has to write an output conforming to the format described below.

<p>

<p>
<br>
In the first line, your program should output the minimum cost of making a passage 
through the bookracks. In the second line, it should print out the increasing sequence 
of all the positions at which a minimum cost passage can be formed.
