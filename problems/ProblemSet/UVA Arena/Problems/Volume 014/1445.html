<span class="textit">International Center for Picassonian Cubism</span> is a Spanish national museum of cubist artworks, 
dedicated to Pablo Picasso. The center held a competition for an artwork that will be 
displayed in front of the facade of the museum building. The artwork is a collection of 
cubes that are piled up on the ground and is intended to amuse visitors, who will be curious 
how the shape of the collection of cubes changes when it is seen from the front and the sides. 

<p>
The artwork is a collection of cubes with edges of one foot long and is built on a ï¬‚at ground 
that is divided into a grid of one foot by one foot squares. Due to some technical reasons, 
cubes of the artwork must be either put on the ground, fitting into a unit square in the grid, 
or put on another cube in the way that the bottom face of the upper cube exactly meets the 
top face of the lower cube. No other way of putting cubes is possible. 

<p>
You are a member of the judging committee responsible for selecting one out of a plenty of 
artwork proposals submitted to the competition. The decision is made primarily based on 
artistic quality but the cost for installing the artwork is another important factor. Your 
task is to investigate the installation cost for each proposal. The cost is proportional to 
the number of cubes, so you have to figure out the minimum number of cubes needed for 
installation. 

<p>
Each design proposal of an artwork consists of the front view and the side view (the view 
seen from the right-hand side), as shown in Figure 1.

</div>

<p>
The front view (resp., the side view) indicates the maximum heights of piles of cubes for 
each column line (resp., row line) of the grid. 

<p>
There are several ways to install this proposal of artwork, such as the following figures.

<p>
<div align="CENTER">

<img width="655" height="189" align="BOTTOM" border="0" src="p4636b.png" alt="\epsfbox{p4636b.eps}">
</div>

<p>
In these figures, the dotted lines on the ground indicate the grid lines. The left figure 
makes use of 16 cubes, which is not optimal. That is, the artwork can be installed with a 
fewer number of cubes. Actually, the right one is optimal and only uses 13 cubes. Note that, 
a single pile of height three in the right figure plays the roles of two such piles in the 
left one. 

<p>
Notice that swapping columns of cubes does not change the side view. Similarly, swapping 
rows does not change the front view. Thus, such swaps do not change the costs of building 
the artworks. For example, consider the artwork proposal given in Figure 2.

<p>
An optimal installation of this proposal of artwork can be achieved with 13 cubes, as shown 
in the following figure, which can be obtained by exchanging the rightmost two columns 
of the optimal installation of the artwork of Figure 1.

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>
The input is a sequence of datasets. The end of the input is indicated by a line containing 
two zeros separated by a space. Each dataset is formatted as follows. 

<p>

<p>
<br>


<span class="MATH"><i>w</i>&nbsp;<i>d</i>
<br><i>h</i><sub>1</sub>&nbsp;<i>h</i><sub>2</sub>&nbsp;...&nbsp;<i>h</i><sub>w</sub>
<br><i>h'</i><sub>1</sub>&nbsp;<i>h'</i><sub>2</sub>&nbsp;...&nbsp;<i>h'</i><sub>d</sub></span>

<p>

<p>
<br>
The integers <span class="MATH"><i>w</i></span> and <span class="MATH"><i>d</i></span> separated by a space are the numbers of columns and rows of the grid, 
respectively. You may assume

maximum heights of cubes per each column line, ordered from left to right (seen from the 
front). The integers <span class="MATH"><i>h'</i><sub>i</sub></span> 
<span class="MATH">(1<img width="18" height="31" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="4636img5.png" alt="$ \le$"><i>h'</i><sub>i</sub><img width="18" height="31" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="4636img5.png" alt="$ \le$">20, 1<img width="18" height="31" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="4636img5.png" alt="$ \le$"><i>i</i><img width="18" height="31" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="4636img5.png" alt="$ \le$"><i>d</i> )</span> in the third line give 
the side view, i.e., the maximum heights of cubes per each row line, ordered from left to 
right (seen from the right-hand side).

Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>
For each dataset, output a line containing the minimum number of cubes. The output should 
not contain any other extra characters. 

<p>
You can assume that, for each dataset, there is at least one way to install the artwork.
