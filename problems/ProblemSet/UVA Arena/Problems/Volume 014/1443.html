Garland decorator is a profession which recently gained in importance, especially during 
Christmas time. Any kid can decorate a christmas tree, any parent can put gifts in 
sockets, and even anyone can start believing in Santa Claus, but hanging christmas 
garlands is a completely difflerent story. As you will learn, it is an extremely 
important, responsible and tough job. 

<p>
A garland consists of <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span> pieces of equal length. Due to decorations like christmas balls 
attached to garlands, piece <span class="MATH"><i>i</i></span> has its own weight <span class="MATH"><i>w</i><sub>i</sub></span>. The garland has to be attached to 
the ceiling in <span class="MATH"><i>m</i></span> spots, where the very beginning of the garland should be attached to spot 
1 and its end to spot <span class="MATH"><i>m</i></span>. The garland should also be hooked to the remaining spots, which 
divides it into segments, each consisting of several consecutive pieces. There are, however, 
several rules that every respectable garland decorator should keep in mind. 

<p>

<p>
<br>
<dl compact="">
<dt>(i)</dt>
<dd>Each segment should contain a positive even number of pieces. Due to this condition, 
we may divide a segment into two <span class="textit">half-segments</span>. 
</dd>
<dt>(ii)</dt>
<dd>To minimize the chance that a guest hits your precious garland with their head 
(and tears it into pieces), the garland cannot hang too low: each half-segment can 
contain at most <span class="MATH"><i>d</i></span> pieces. 
</dd>
<dt>(iii)</dt>
<dd>Finally, to keep the ceiling from falling on people heads, the decorator should 
minimize the weight of the heaviest half-segment. 
</dd>
</dl>

<p>

An example of an optimally hanging garland (consisting of twelve pieces in three segments) 
is presented below; weights of respective pieces are given in circles.

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
The input contains several test cases. The first line of the input contains a positive 
integer <span class="MATH"><i>Z</i><img width="18" height="31" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="4625img2.png" alt="$ \le$">50</span>, denoting the number of test cases. Then <span class="MATH"><i>Z</i></span> test cases follow, each conforming 
to the format described below.

<p>

<p>
<br>
The description of each garland consists of two lines. The first line describing a particular 
garland contains three positive integers <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span>, <span class="MATH"><i>m</i></span>, and <span class="MATH"><i>d</i></span> 
<span class="MATH">(1<img width="18" height="31" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="4625img2.png" alt="$ \le$"><i>n</i><img width="18" height="31" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="4625img2.png" alt="$ \le$">40000, 2<img width="18" height="31" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="4625img2.png" alt="$ \le$"><i>m</i><img width="18" height="31" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="4625img2.png" alt="$ \le$">10000, 1<img width="18" height="31" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="4625img2.png" alt="$ \le$"><i>d</i><img width="18" height="31" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="4625img2.png" alt="$ \le$">10000)</span> separated by single spaces and described above. The second 
line contains <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span> positive integers 
<span class="MATH"><i>w</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>w</i><sub>2</sub>,..., <i>w</i><sub>n</sub></span> 
<span class="MATH">(1<img width="18" height="31" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="4625img2.png" alt="$ \le$"><i>w</i><sub>i</sub><img width="18" height="31" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="4625img2.png" alt="$ \le$">10000)</span>, 
being the weights of the corresponding pieces.

Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
For each test case, your program has to write an 
output conforming to the format described below.

<p>

<p>
<br>
For each garland, your program should output a single line containing one integer, being 
the weight of the heaviest half-segment in an optimal attachment of the garland. If it 
is not possible to hang the garland satisfying conditions (i) and (ii), then your program 
should output word `<tt>BAD</tt>'.
