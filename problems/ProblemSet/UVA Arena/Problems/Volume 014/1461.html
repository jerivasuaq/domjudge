Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 
<span class="MATH">9 <tt>x</tt> 9</span> grid so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 
<span class="MATH">3 <tt>x</tt> 3</span> boxes 
(also called blocks or regions) contains the digits from 1 to 9 only one time each. The puzzle setter provides 
a partially completed grid.[from wikipedia] 

<p>
Left figure is the puzzle and right figure is one solution for that puzzle.

It's a very common game for magazine and newspapers, and people like it for killing time. 
How about adding some features to this game, some cells can only be filled with even number, 
some cells can only be filled with odd number, and some cells can only be filled with the 
same number. Great, let's call it ``Sudoku Extension". 

<p>
It's very easy to give one possible 
solution a Sudoku Extension puzzle, but do you know how many solutions are there for a 
certain Sudoku Extension problem? Let's find out!

<h2><font size="4" color="#ff0000"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">
Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>
The input data will start with the number of test cases. For each test case, 9 lines 
followed, corresponding to the rows of the table. On each line, a string of exactly 9 
characters is given, it's either <tt>0-9</tt> digit, or <tt>a-z</tt> alpha in lower case. 
`<tt>1</tt>' - `<tt>9</tt>' means the cell is already filled in; `<tt>0</tt>' means this 
cell is empty; `<tt>e</tt>' means the cell need to be filled with a even number; `<tt>o</tt>' 
means the cell need to be filled with an odd number; 
other alpha of `<tt>a</tt>' - `<tt>z</tt>', except `<tt>e</tt>' and `<tt>o</tt>' denote a 
variable, so if two or more cells denoted by `<tt>a</tt>', then they must be filled with 
the same number.
