There are two strings A and B with equal length. Both strings are made up of lower case letters. Now you have a powerful string painter. With the help of the painter, you can change a segment of characters of a string to any other character you want. That is, after using the painter, the segment is made up of only one kind of character. Now your task is to change A to B using string painter. What's the minimum number of operations?
