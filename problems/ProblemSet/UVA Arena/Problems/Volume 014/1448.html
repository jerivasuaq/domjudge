ICPC (International Connecting Points Company) starts to sell a new railway toy. It 
consists of a toy tramcar and many rail units on square frames of the same size. There 
are four types of rail units, namely, straight (S), curve (C), left-switch (L) and 
right-switch (R) as shown in Figure 9. A switch has three ends, namely, 
branch/merge-end (B/M-end), straight-end (S-end) and curve-end (C-end).

</div>

<p>
A switch is either in ``through" or ``branching" state. When the tramcar comes from 
B/M-end, and if the switch is in the through-state, the tramcar goes through to S-end 
and the state changes to branching; if the switch is in the branching-state, it branches 
toward C-end and the state changes to through. When the tramcar comes from S-end or C-end, 
it goes out from B/M-end regardless of the state. The state does not change in this case. 

<p>
Kids are given rail units of various types that fill a rectangle area of 
<span class="MATH"><i>w</i> <tt>x</tt> <i>h</i></span>, as shown 
in Figure 10(a). Rail units meeting at an edge of adjacent two frames are automatically 
connected. Each rail unit may be independently rotated around the center of its frame by 
multiples of 90 degrees in order to change the connection of rail units, but its position 
cannot be changed. 

<p>
Kids should make ``valid" layouts by rotating each rail unit, such as getting Figure 10(b) 
from Figure 10(a). A layout is valid when all rails at three ends of every switch are 
directly or indirectly connected to an end of another switch or itself. A layout in Figure 
10(c) is invalid as well as Figure 10(a). Invalid layouts are frowned upon. 

<p>
When a tramcar runs in a valid layout, it will eventually begin to repeat the same route 
forever. That is, we will eventually find the tramcar periodically comes to the same running 
condition, which is a triple of the tramcar position in the rectangle area, its direction, 
and the set of the states of all the switches. 

<p>

<p>
<br>
A periodical route is a sequence of rail units on which the tramcar starts from a rail unit 
with a running condition and returns to the same rail unit with the same running condition 
for the first time.

</div>

<p>
A periodical route through a switch or switches is called the ``fun route", since 
kids like the rattling sound the tramcar makes when it passes through a switch. The tramcar 
takes the same unit time to go through a rail unit, not depending on the types of the unit 
or the tramcar directions. After the tramcar starts on a rail unit on a ``fun route", it 
will come back to the same unit with the same running condition, sooner or later. The fun 
time <span class="MATH"><i>T</i></span> of a fun route is the number of time units that the tramcar takes for going around 
the route. 

<p>
Of course, kids better enjoy layouts with longer fun time. Given a variety of rail units 
placed on a rectangular area, your job is to rotate the given rail units appropriately and 
to find the fun route with the longest fun time in the valid layouts. 

<p>
For example, there is a fun route in Figure 10(b). Its fun time is 24. Let the toy tramcar 
start from B/M-end at (1, 2) toward (1, 3) and the states of all the switches are the 
through-states. It goes through (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (2, 4), (1, 4), (1, 3), 
(1, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2) and (1, 2). Here, the tramcar goes through (1, 2) with the 
same position and the same direction, but with the different states of the switches. Then 
the tramcar goes through (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 5), (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 3), (1, 2), 
(2, 2), (2, 1), (1, 1) and (1, 2). Here, the tramcar goes through (1, 2) again, but with 
the same switch states as the initial ones. Counting the rail units the tramcar visited, 
the tramcar should have run 24 units of time after its start, and thus the fun time is 24. 

<p>
There may be many valid layouts with the given rail units. For example, a valid layout 
containing a fun route with the fun time 120 is shown in Figure 11(a). Another valid layout 
containing a fun route with the fun time 148 derived from that in Figure 11(a) is shown in 
Figure 11(b). The four rail units whose rotations are changed from Figure 11(a) are indicated 
by the thick lines. 

<p>
A valid layout depicted in Figure 12(a) contains two fun routes, where one consists of 
the rail units (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (3, 2), (2, 2), (1, 2) with <span class="MATH"><i>T</i> = 8</span>, 
and the other consists of all the remaining rail units with <span class="MATH"><i>T</i> = 18</span>.

<div align="CENTER">Figure 11: valid layouts

</div>

<p>
Another valid layout depicted in Figure 12(b) has two fun routes whose fun times are <span class="MATH"><i>T</i> = 12</span> 
and <span class="MATH"><i>T</i> = 20</span>. The layout in Figure 12(a) is different from that in Figure 12(b) at the eight 
rail units rotated by multiples of 90 degrees. There are other valid layouts with some 
rotations of rail units but there is no fun route with the fun time longer than 20, so that 
the longest fun time for this example (Figure 12) is 20.

<p>
Note that there may be simple cyclic routes that do not go through any switches in a valid 
layout, which are not counted as the fun routes. In Figure 13, there are two fun routes 
and one simple cyclic route. Their fun times are 12 and 14, respectively. The required 
time for going around the simple cyclic route is 20 that is greater than fun times of 
the fun routes. However, the longest fun time is still 14.
