One of the preferred kinds of entertainment of people living in final stages
of XX century is filling in the crosswords. Almost every newspaper and
magazine has a column dedicated to entertainment but only amateurs have enough
after solving one crossword. Real professionals require more than one
crossword for a week. And it is so dull - just crosswords and crosswords -
while so many other riddles are waiting out there. For those are special,
dedicated magazines. There are also quite a few competitions to take part in,
even reaching the level of World Championships. Anyway - a lot.

<p>

<p>

You were taken on by such a professional for whom riddle solving competing is
just a job. He had a brilliant idea to use a computer in work not just to
play games. Somehow anagrams found themselves first in the line. You are to
write a program which searches for anagrams of given words, using a given
vocabulary, tediously filled with new words by yours employer.

<p>

<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">
Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
The first line of the input is an integer M, then a blank line followed by M datasets. There is a blank line between datasets.

The structure of each dataset is given below:

<p>
<pre>
&lt;number of words in vocabulary&gt;
&lt;word 1&gt;
..............
&lt;word N&gt;
&lt;test word 1&gt;
................
&lt;test word k&gt;
END
</pre>

<p>

<code>&lt;number of words in vocabulary&gt;</code> is an integer number <i>N</i> &lt; 1000. <code>&lt;word 1&gt;</code> up
to <code>&lt;word N&gt;</code> are words from the vocabulary. <code>&lt;test word 1&gt;</code> up to <code>&lt;test word k&gt;</code>
are the words to find anagrams for. All words are lowercase (word END means
end of data - it is NOT a test word). You can assume all words are not
longer than 20 characters.

<p>

<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">
Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
For each <code>&lt;test word&gt;</code> list the found anagrams in the following way:

<p>
<pre>
Anagrams for: &lt;test word&gt;
&lt;No&gt;) &lt;anagram&gt;
...............
</pre>

<p>

<code>&lt;No&gt;</code> should be printed on 3 chars.

<p>
In case of failing to find any anagrams your output should look like this:

<p>
<pre>
Anagrams for: &lt;test word&gt;
No anagrams for: &lt;test word&gt;
</pre>

<p>Print a blank line between datasets.
