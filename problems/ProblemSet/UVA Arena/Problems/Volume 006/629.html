<p>
Statistical analysis quite often involves questions whether differences
between samples are meaningful. Lack of meaningful differences indicates that
the samples do not differ with respect to studied feature. The bigger the
number of samples the bigger are troubles we find ourselves in, because
it is much more difficult then to delimit sets of non-differing samples.

<p>

<p>
<br>
Let's assume we have three samples P1, P2, P3. We also know that P1 differs
meaningfully from P2, but others do not differ. Thus we have two sets of
samples not different meaningfully. First one contains P1 and P3 (because
they it is not stated that they differ meaningfully) and respectively the
second one contains P2 and P3 (similar as earlier).

<p>
As you can see these
sets are not separate. It is going to be handy to denote the belonging to
the set with a character associated with it. In our case we
have: P1:<tt>a</tt> P2:<tt>b</tt> P3:<tt>ab</tt>.

<p>

<p>
<br>

<b>Conclusions:</b>
<ul>
<li>if all the samples did not differ then they would belong to the same set (set <tt>a</tt>).
<li>if all the samples DID differ from each other then each belongs to separate, one-element set (P1:<tt>a</tt> P2:<tt>b</tt> P3:<tt>c</tt> etc.)
</li></li></ul>

<p>
Your task is to write a program which delimits sets without meaningful differences.

<p>

<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">
Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
A number (<i>n</i>) of samples in the first line, in ``<i>n</i>" consecutive ones an incidence
matrix which describes the differences between samples is given. The actual
information in the matrix is given above the primary diagonal. Symbol `<tt>*</tt>'
depicts meaningful differences, symbol `<tt>-</tt>' depicts no meaningful differences.

<p>

<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">
Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
For each matrix ``<i>n</i>" lines (each representing one sample) enumerating sets
to which the sample belongs, and then a line with 5 hyphens.

<p>

<p>
<br>

<b>Assumptions:</b>
Number of samples in one test does not exceed 10. The most numerous set
acquires the character ``<tt>a</tt>", the second in the line ``<tt>b</tt>" etc. In case of sets
having the same number of elements the first one goes the one which contains
a sample of lower number.
