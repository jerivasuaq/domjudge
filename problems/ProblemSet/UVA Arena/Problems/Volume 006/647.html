<p>
A popular board game for children is called ``Chutes and Ladders".  The board has squares which
are numbered from 1 to 100, and players have counters which start on the theoretical square 0.  
The players take turns at throwing a die with the numbers 1 to 6 on it, and each moves his or her 
counter forward the number of squares corresponding to the number on the die (the square they 
reach is found by adding the die number to the square number their counter is on).  The first 
person to reach square 100 is the winner. 

<p>

<p>
<br>
The interest is caused by the fact that pairs of squares are connected together by ``ladders" (which
connect a lower-numbered square to a higher-numbered square) and ``chutes" (which run from
high to low).  If a counter lands on the start of a chute or ladder (i.e., this is the square reached 
after throwing the die), then the counter is moved to the corresponding square at the end of the 
chute or ladder.  Note that landing on the end square of a ladder or a chute has no effect, only the 
start square counts.  Furthermore, there are some squares such that if a player's counter lands on 
them, then the player must either miss the next turn, or immediately throw the die again for 
another turn, depending on what is written on the board.  A miss-a-turn or extra-turn square is 
never the start or end of a ladder or chute.  If a player is on square 95 or higher, then a die throw 
which takes them past 100 must be ignored - thus a player on square 99 must ignore all throws 
which are not 1.

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
Input will start with a set of less than 1000 die throws
which you must use for all games, starting each new game with the first player ``throwing" the first
number in the set, the next player ``throwing" the second number, and so on.  This set of die
throws will simply be a list of random numbers between 1 and 6, separated by single spaces, with 
not more than 80 characters on each line.  It will be terminated by the number 0.  

<p>

<p>
<br>
After this set of 
die throws, there will be one or more game sets.  Each game set is in three parts.  

<p>
The first part is 
a line containing a single number giving the number of players in the game.  This will be more 
than 1 and less than 6.  Then the board is described, in two parts. 

<p>
The first part lists the ladders 
and the chutes on the board, each ladder or chute being defined on a single line.  Each is given by 
two numbers, from 1 to 99, separated by one or more spaces.  The first number gives the start 
square, and the second number gives the end square; so it is a ladder if the first number is less 
than the second number, and a chute if the order is the other way.  The chute/ladder definitions 
are terminated by a line containing two 0's.  

<p>
The second part of the board description gives the 
lose-a-turn/extra-turn squares, if there are any.  These are single numbers, one per line, defining 
the squares.  If the number is negative, its positive counterpart is a lose-a-turn square; if positive, 
it represents an extra-turn square.  (For example, -16 means that square 16 on the board is a 
lose-a-turn square, while a 25 means that players landing on square 25 must immediately roll 
again.)   

<p>
The end of this set of descriptions, and of the game description, is given by a single 0.  

<p>

<p>
<br>
The end of all the game descriptions is given by a game with the number of players equal to 0.

Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
Output must be one line for each game in the input, giving the number of the player who wins the 
game.  Every game will determine a winner in fewer throws than those given at the start of the data.
