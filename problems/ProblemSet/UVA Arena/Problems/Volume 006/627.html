<p>
Taking into account the present interest in the Internet, a smart information
routing becomes a must. This job is done by routers situated in the nodes of
the network. Each router has its own list of routers which are visible for
him (so called ``routing table"). It is obvious that the information should be
directed in the way which minimizes number of routers it has to pass (so
called ``hop count").

<p>

<p>
<br>
Your task is to find an optimal route (minimal hop count) for the given
network form the source of the information to its destination.

<p>

<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">
Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
First line contains number of routers in the network (<i>n</i>). Next <i>n</i> lines contain
description of the network. Each line contains router <i>ID</i>, followed by a hyphen
and comma separated list of <i>ID</i>s of visible routers. The list is sorted in
ascending order. Next line contains a number of routes (<i>m</i>) you should determine.
The consecutive <i>m</i> lines contain starting and ending routers for the route separated by a single space. 

<p>
Input data may contain descriptions of many networks.

<p>

<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">
Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
For each network you should output a line with 5 hyphens and then, for each
route, a list of routers passed by information sent from starting to
destination routers. 

<p>
In case passing of information is impossible (no
connection exists) you should output a string ``<tt>connection impossible</tt>". In case
of multiple routes with the same `hop count' the one with lower <i>ID</i>s should be
outputted (in case of route form router 1 to 2 as 1 3 2 and 1 4 2 the 1 3 2 should be outputted).

<p>

<p><p>
<br>

<b>Assumptions:</b> A number of routers is not greater than 300 and there are at least 2 routers in the network. Each routers ``sees" no more than 50 routers.
