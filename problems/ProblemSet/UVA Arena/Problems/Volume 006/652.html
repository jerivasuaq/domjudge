The 15-puzzle has been around for over 100 years; even if you don't know it by that name, you've
seen it. It is constructed with 15 sliding tiles, each with a number from 1 to 15 on it, and all packed
into a 4 by 4 frame with one tile missing. Let's call the missing tile `<tt>x</tt>'; the object of the puzzle is
to arrange the tiles so that they are ordered as:

<p>
<pre>
 1  2  3  4
 5  6  7  8
 9 10 11 12
13 14 15  x
</pre>
where the only legal operation is to exchange `<tt>x</tt>' with one of the tiles with which it shares an edge.
As an example, the following sequence of moves solves a slightly scrambled puzzle:

<p>
<pre>
 1  2  3  4     1  2  3  4     1  2  3  4     1  2  3  4 
 5  6  7  8     5  6  7  8     5  6  7  8     5  6  7  8
 9  x 10 12     9 10  x 12     9 10 11 12     9 10 11 12
13 14 11 15    13 14 11 15    13 14  x 15    13 14 15  x
            r-&gt;            d-&gt;            r-&gt;
</pre>

<p>
The letters in the previous row indicate which neighbor of the `<tt>x</tt>' tile is swapped with the `<tt>x</tt>' tile at
each step; legal values are `<tt>r</tt>',`<tt>l</tt>',`<tt>u</tt>' and `<tt>d</tt>', for right, left, up, and down, respectively.

<p>

<p>
<br>
Not all puzzles can be solved; in 1870, a man named Sam Loyd was famous for distributing an
unsolvable version of the puzzle, and
frustrating many people. In fact, all you have to do to make a regular puzzle into an unsolvable one
is to swap two tiles (not counting the missing `<tt>x</tt>' tile, of course).

<p>

<p>
<br>
In this problem, you will write a program for solving the less well-known 8-puzzle, composed of tiles on a three by three arrangement.

<p>

<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">
Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
The first line of the input is an integer N, then a blank line followed by N datasets. There is a blank line between datasets.

<p>In each dataset, you will receive a description of a configuration of the 8 puzzle. The description
is just a list of the tiles in their initial positions, with the rows listed from top to bottom, and the tiles
listed from left to right within a row, where the tiles are represented by numbers 1 to 8, plus `<tt>x</tt>'.

<p>
For example, this puzzle
<pre>
1 2 3
x 4 6
7 5 8
</pre>
is described by this list:
<pre>
1 2 3 x 4 6 7 5 8
</pre>

<p>

<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">
Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
For each dataset, you will print to standard output either the word ``<tt>unsolvable</tt>'', if the puzzle has no solution, or a
string consisting entirely of the letters `<tt>r</tt>', `<tt>l</tt>', `<tt>u</tt>' and `<tt>d</tt>' that describes a series of moves that
produce a solution. The string should include no spaces and start at the beginning of the line. Print a blank line between datasets.
