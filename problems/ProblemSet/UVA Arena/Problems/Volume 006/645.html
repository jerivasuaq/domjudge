It is often helpful for computer users to see a visual representation of the file structure on their
computers.  The ``explorer" in Microsoft Windows is an example of such a system.  Before the 
days of graphical user interfaces, however, such visual representations were not possible.  The 
best that could be done was to show a static ``map" of directories and files, using indentation as a 
guide to directory contents.  For example:

<p>
<pre>
ROOT
|     DIR1
|     File1
|     File2
|     File3
|     DIR2
|     DIR3
|     File1
File1
File2
</pre>

<p>
This shows that the root directory contains two files and three subdirectories.  The first 
subdirectory contains 3 files, the second is empty and the third contains one file.

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
Write a program that reads a series of data sets representing a computer file structure.
A data set ends with a line containing a single `<tt>*</tt>', and the end of valid
data is denoted by a line containing a single `<tt>#</tt>'.  

<p>
The data set contains a series of file and directory 
names.  (The root directory is assumed to be the starting point.) The end of a directory is denoted 
by a `<tt>]</tt>'.  

<p>
Directory names begin with a lower case `<tt>d</tt>' and file names begin with a lower case `<tt>f</tt>'.  
File names may or may not have an extension (such as <tt>fmyfile.dat</tt> or <tt>fmyfile</tt>).  

<p>
File and directory names may not contain spaces. 

<p>

<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">
Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
The contents of any directory should list any subdirectories first, followed by files, if any.  
All files should be in alphabetical order within each directory.  

<p>
Note that each data set output is 
marked by the label `<tt>DATA SET </tt><i>x</i><tt>:</tt>', where <i>x</i> denotes the number of the set, beginning at 1.  

<p>
Note also the blank line between the output data sets.  Each level of indentation should show a `<tt>|</tt>' followed by 5 spaces.

<p>
