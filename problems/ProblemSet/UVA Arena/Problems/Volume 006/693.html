<p>You have an ideally small racing car on an <i>x</i>-<i>y</i> plane ( <img height="30" alt="$0 \leY x, y \leY 255$" src="693img1.gif" width="113" align="middle" border="0">, where bigger y 
denotes upper coordinate). The racing circuit course is figured by two solid 
walls. Each wall is a closed loop of connected line segments. End point 
coordinates of every line segment are both integers (See Figure 1). Thus, a wall 
is represented by a list of end point integer coordinates (<i>x</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>y</i><sub>1</sub>), (<i>x</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>y</i><sub>2</sub>), ..., (<i>x</i><sub><i>n</i></sub>, 
<i>y</i><sub><i>n</i></sub>). The start line and the goal line are identical. 
<p>
<div align="center"><img src="p693.gif" width="285" height="285"> 
<p>Figure 1. A Simple Course </p></div>
<p>For the qualification run, you start the car at any integer coordinate 
position on the start line, say 
(<i>s</i><sub><i>x</i></sub> , 
<i>s</i><sub><i>y</i></sub>). 
<p>
<p><br>At any clock <img height="34" alt="$t (\ge- 0)$" src="693img2.gif" width="52" align="middle" border="0">, according to the 
acceleration parameter at <i>t</i>, 
(<i>a</i><sub><i>x</i>,<i>t</i></sub>, 
<i>a</i><sub><i>y</i>,<i>t</i></sub>), the velocity changes instantly to (<i>v</i><sub><i>x</i>,<i>t</i>-1</sub> 
+ <i>a</i><sub><i>x</i>,<i>t</i></sub>, <i>v</i><sub><i>y</i>,<i>t</i>-1</sub> + 
<i>a</i><sub><i>y</i>,<i>t</i></sub>), if the velocity at <i>t</i> - 1 is (<i>v</i><sub><i>x</i>,<i>t</i>-1</sub>, 
<i>v</i><sub><i>y</i>,<i>t</i>-1</sub>). The velocity will be kept constant 
until the next clock. It is assumed that the velocity at clock -1, (<i>v</i><sub><i>x</i>,-1</sub>, 
<i>v</i><sub><i>y</i>,-1</sub>) is (0, 0). Each of the acceleration components 
must be either -1, 0, or 1, because your car does not have so fantastic engine 
and brake. In other words, any successive pair of velocities should not differ 
more than 1 for either <i>x</i>-component or <i>y</i>-component. Note that your 
trajectory will be piecewise linear as the walls are. 
<p>
<p><br>Your car should not touch nor run over the circuit wall, or your car will 
be crashed, even at the start line. The referee watches your car's trajectory 
very carefully, checking whether or not the trajectory touches the wall or 
attempts to cross the wall. 
<p>
<p><br>The objective of the qualification run is to finish your run within as 
few clock units as possible, without suffering from any interference by other 
racing cars. That is, you run alone the circuit around clockwise and reach, 
namely touch or go across the goal line without having been crashed. Don't be 
crashed even in the last trajectory segment after you reach the goal line. But 
we don't care whatever happens after that clock. 
<p>
<p><br>Your final lap time is the clock <i>t</i> when you reach the goal line 
for the first time after you have once left the start line. But it needs a 
little adjustment at the goal instant. When you cross the goal line, only the 
necessary fraction of your car's last trajectory segment is counted. For 
example, if the length of your final trajectory segment is 3 and only its 1/3 
fraction is needed to reach the goal line, you have to add only 0.333 instead of 
1 clock unit. 
<p>
<p><br>Drivers are requested to control their cars as cleverly as possible to 
run fast but avoiding crash. ALAS! The racing committee decided that it is too 
DANGEROUS to allow novices to run the circuit. In the last year, it was reported 
that some novices wrenched their fingers by typing too enthusiastically their 
programs. So, this year, you are invited as a referee assistant in order to 
accumulate the experience on this dangerous car race. 
<p>
<p><br>A number of experienced drivers are now running the circuit for the 
qualification for semi-finals. They submit their driving records to the referee. 
The referee has to check the records one by one whether it is not a fake. 
<p>
<p><br>Now, you are requested to make a program to check the validity of driving 
records for any given course configuration. Is the start point right on the 
start line without touching the walls? Is every value in the acceleration 
parameter list either one of -1, 0, and 1? Does the length of acceleration 
parameter list match the reported lap time? That is, aren't there any excess 
acceleration parameters after the goal, or are these enough to reach the goal? 
Doesn't it involve any crash? Does it mean a clockwise running all around? (Note 
that it is not inhibited to run backward temporarily unless crossing the start 
line again.) Is the lap time calculation correct? You should allow a rounding 
error up to 0.01 clock unit in the lap time.

<h2><font color="#0070e8"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</a>&nbsp;</font> </h2>
<p>The input 
consists of several courses and the first line of input is number of
courses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<p><br>A course configuration is given by two lists representing the inner wall 
and the outer wall, respectively. Each list shows the end point coordinates of 
the line segments that comprise the wall. A course configuration looks as 
follows: 
<p>
<p><br><img height="31" alt="$i_{x,1} \ i_{y,1} \dots i_{x,N} \ i_{y,N} \ \mbox{\tt 99999}$" src="693img3.gif" width="203" align="middle" border="0"> 
<p><img height="30" alt="$o_{x,1} \ o_{y,1} \dots o_{x,M} \ o_{y,M} \ \mbox{\tt 99999}$" src="693img4.gif" width="218" align="middle" border="0"> 
<p>
<p><br>where data are alternating <i>x</i>-coordinates and <i>y</i>-coordinates 
that are all non-negative integers <img height="34" alt="$(\leY 255)$" src="693img5.gif" width="63" align="middle" border="0"> terminated by <tt>99999</tt>. The start/goal line is a line segment 
connecting the coordinates 
(<i>i</i><sub><i>x</i>,1</sub>, 
<i>i</i><sub><i>y</i>,1</sub>) and 
(<i>o</i><sub><i>x</i>,1</sub>, 
<i>o</i><sub><i>y</i>,1</sub>). For simplicity, <i>i</i><sub><i>y</i>,1</sub> is 
assumed to be equal to <i>o</i><sub><i>y</i>,1</sub>; that is, the start/goal 
line is horizontal on the <i>x</i>-<i>y</i> plane. Note that <i>N</i> and 
<i>M</i> may vary among course configurations, but do not exceed 100, because 
too many curves involve much danger even for experienced drivers. You need not 
check the validity of the course configuration. 
<p>
<p><br>A driving record consists of three parts, which is terminated by 
<tt>99999</tt>: two integers <i>s</i><sub><i>x</i></sub>, 
<i>s</i><sub><i>y</i></sub> for the start position 
(<i>s</i><sub><i>x</i></sub>, 
<i>s</i><sub><i>y</i></sub>), the lap time with three digits after the decimal 
point, and the sequential list of acceleration parameters at all clocks until 
the goal. It is assumed that the length of the acceleration parameter list does 
not exceed 500. A driving record looks like the following: 
<p>
<p><br><img height="30" alt="$s_x \ s_y$" src="693img6.gif" width="43" align="middle" border="0"> 
<p><i>lap</i>-<i>time</i> 
<p><img height="30" alt="$a_{x,0} \ a_{y,0} \ a_{x,1} \ a_{y,1} \dots a_{x,L} \ a_{y,L} \ \mbox{\tt 99999}$" src="693img7.gif" width="278" align="middle" border="0"> 
<p>
<p><br>The list of the record of a course is terminated by a null driving 
record; that is, it is terminated by a <tt>99999</tt> that immediately follows 
<tt>99999</tt> of the last driving record.&nbsp; 
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070e8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</a>&nbsp;</font> </h2>The test result 
should be reported by simply printing <tt>OK</tt> or <tt>NG</tt> for each 
driving record, each result in each line. No other letter is allowed in the
