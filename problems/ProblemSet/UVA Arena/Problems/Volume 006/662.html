<p>
The fastfood chain McBurger owns several restaurants along a highway. Recently, they have decided
to build several depots along the highway, each one located at a restaurent and supplying several of the
restaurants with the needed ingredients. Naturally, these depots should be placed so that the average
distance between a restaurant and its assigned depot is minimized. You are to write a program that
computes the optimal positions and assignments of the depots.

<p>

<p>
<br>
To make this more precise, the management of McBurger has issued the following specification:
You will be given the positions of <i>n</i> restaurants along the highway as <i>n</i>
integers 

<img width="146" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="662img1.gif" alt="$d_1 < d_2 < \dots < d_n$">
(these are the distances measured from the
company's headquarter, which happens to be at the same highway). Furthermore,
a number 

<img width="71" height="34" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="662img2.gif" alt="$k (k \leY n)$">
will be given, the number of depots to be built.

<p>
The <i>k</i> depots will be built at the locations of <i>k</i> different restaurants.
Each restaurant will be assigned to the closest depot, from which it will then
receive its supplies. To minimize shipping costs, the <em>total distance sum</em>,
defined as

<br><p>
<div align="CENTER">



<img width="379" height="55" src="662img3.gif" alt="\begin{displaymath}\sum_{i=1}^n \mid d_i - (\mbox{position of depot serving restaurant }i) \mid
\end{displaymath}">
</div>
<br clear="ALL">
<p>
must be as small as possible.

<p>
Write a program that computes the positions of the <i>k</i> depots, such that the
total distance sum is minimized.

<p>

<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">
Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
The input file contains several descriptions of fastfood chains. Each description starts with a line
containing the two integers <i>n</i> and <i>k</i>. <i>n</i> and <i>k</i> will satisfy 

<img width="96" height="30" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="662img4.gif" alt="$1 \leY n
\leY 200$">,


<img width="87" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="662img5.gif" alt="$1 \leY k Y\le 30$">,
<img width="48" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="662img6.gif" alt="$k \le n$">.
Following this will <i>n</i> lines
containing one integer each, giving the positions <i>d</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> of the restaurants,
ordered increasingly.

<p>
The input file will end with a case starting with <i>n</i> = <i>k</i> = 0. This case
should not be processed.

<p>

<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">
Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
For each chain, first output the number of the chain. Then output an optimal placement of the depots
as follows: for each depot output a line containing its position and the range of restaurants it serves.
If there is more than one optimal solution, output any of them. After the depot descriptions output a
line containing the total distance sum, as defined in the problem text.

<p>

<p>
<br>
Output a blank line after each test case.
