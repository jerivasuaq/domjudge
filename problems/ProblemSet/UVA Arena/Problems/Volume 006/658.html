<p>
It is a curious fact that consumers buying a new software product generally do
<em>not</em> expect the software to be bug-free. Can you imagine buying a car
whose steering wheel only turns to the right? Or a CD-player that plays only
CDs with country music on them? Probably not. But for software systems it
seems to be acceptable if they do not perform as they should do. In fact, many
software companies have adopted the habit of sending out patches to fix bugs
every few weeks after a new product is released (and even charging money for
the patches).

<p>
Tinyware Inc. is one of those companies. After releasing a new word processing software this
summer, they have been producing patches ever since. Only this weekend they have realized a big
problem with the patches they released. While all patches fix some bugs, they often rely on other
bugs to be present to be installed. This happens because to fix one bug, the patches exploit the special
behavior of the program due to another bug.

<p>
More formally, the situation looks like this. Tinyware has found a total of
<i>n</i> bugs 

<img width="152" height="34" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="658img1.gif" alt="$B= \{b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n\}$">
in their software. And they have
released <i>m</i> patches 

<img width="105" height="30" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="658img2.gif" alt="$p_1, p_2, \dots, p_m$">.
To apply patch <i>p</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> to the
software, the bugs 

<img width="67" height="38" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="658img3.gif" alt="$B^+_i \subseteq B$">
have to be present in the software, and
the bugs 

<img width="67" height="38" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="658img4.gif" alt="$B^-_i \subseteq B$">
must be absent (of course


<img width="107" height="38" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="658img5.gif" alt="$B^+_i \cap B^-_i = \emptyset$">
holds). The patch then
fixes the bugs 

<img width="67" height="38" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="658img6.gif" alt="$F^-_i \subseteq B$">
(if they have been present) and introduces
the new bugs 

<img width="67" height="38" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="658img7.gif" alt="$F^+_i \subseteq B$">
(where, again, 

<img width="106" height="38" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="658img8.gif" alt="$F^-_i \cap B^-_i = \emptyset$">).

<p>
Tinyware's problem is a simple one. Given the original version of their software, which contains
all the bugs in <i>B</i>, it is possible to apply a sequence of patches to the
software which results in a bug- free version of the software? And if so,
assuming that every patch takes a certain time to apply, how long does the
fastest sequence take?

<p>

<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">
Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
The input contains several product descriptions. Each description starts with a line containing two
integers <i>n</i> and <i>m</i>, the number of bugs and patches, respectively. These
values satisfy 

<img width="88" height="30" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="658img9.gif" alt="$1 \le n \le 20$">
and 

<img width="101" height="30" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="658img10.gif" alt="$1 \le m \le 100$">.
This is followed by <i>m</i>
lines describing the <i>m</i> patches in order. Each line contains an integer, the
time in seconds it takes to apply the patch, and two strings of <i>n</i> characters
each.

<p>
The first of these strings describes the bugs that have to be present or absent before the patch can
be applied. The <i>i</i>-th position of that string is a ``<tt>+</tt>'' if bug <i>b</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>
has to be present, a ``<tt>-</tt>'' if bug <i>b</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> has to be absent, and a ``<tt>
0</tt>'' if it doesn't matter whether the bug is present or not.

<p>
The second string describes which bugs are fixed and introduced by the patch.
The <i>i</i>-th position of that string is a ``<tt>+</tt>'' if bug <i>b</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> is introduced
by the patch, a ``<tt>-</tt>'' if bug <i>b</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> is removed by the patch (if it was
present), and a ``<tt>0</tt>'' if bug <i>b</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> is not affected by the patch (if it
was present before, it still is, if it wasn't, is still isn't).

<p>
The input is terminated by a description starting with <i>n</i> = <i>m</i> = 0. This test
case should not be processed.

<p>

<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">
Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
For each product description first output the number of the product. Then output whether there is a
sequence of patches that removes all bugs from a product that has all <i>n</i> bugs. Note that in such a
sequence a patch may be used multiple times. If there is such a sequence, output the time taken by
the fastest sequence in the format shown in the sample output. If there is no such sequence, output
``<tt>Bugs cannot be fixed.</tt>''.

<p>
Print a blank line after each test case.
