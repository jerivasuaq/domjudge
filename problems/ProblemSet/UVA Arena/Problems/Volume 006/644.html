<p>
An encoding of a set of symbols is said to be <em>immediately</em> decodable if no code for one symbol is 
the prefix of a code for another symbol.  We will assume for this problem that all codes are in 
binary, that no two codes within a set of codes are the same, that each code has at least one bit 
and no more than ten bits, and that each set has at least two codes and no more than eight.

<p>

<p>
<br>

<b>Examples:</b>  Assume an alphabet that has symbols  {<tt>A, B, C, D</tt>}

<p>

<p>
<br>
The following code is immediately decodable:

<p>

<p>
<br>

<code>     A:01   B:10   C:0010   D:0000</code>

<p>

<p>
<br>
but this one is not:

<p>

<p>
<br>

<code>     A:01   B:10   C:010   D:0000</code>    (Note that <tt>A</tt> is a prefix of <tt>C</tt>)

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
Write a program that accepts as input a series of groups of records from a data file.
Each record in a group contains a collection of zeroes and ones representing a binary code for a 
different symbol.  Each group is followed by a single separator record containing a single 9; the 
separator records are not part of the group. Each group is independent of other groups; the codes 
in one group are not related to codes in any other group (that is, each group is to be processed 
independently).

<p>

<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">
Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
For each group, your program should determine whether the codes in that group
are immediately decodable, and should print a single output line giving the group number and 
stating whether the group is, or is not, immediately decodable.

<p>

The Sample Input describes the examples above.
