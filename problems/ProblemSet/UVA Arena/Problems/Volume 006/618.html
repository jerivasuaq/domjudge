<p>
The screen of monitors on computer systems are rectangles.  The <em>aspect ratio</em>
of a screen is its width divided by its height.  This term can also be applied
to rectangular windows that may appear on the monitor's screen, where it is
defined
as the width of the window divided by its height.  For this problem we assume
the dimensions of a monitor's screen and its windows are measured in integral
numbers
of pixels, the individual dots (arranged in a rectangular grid) that comprise
and image.

<p>

<p>
<br>
Suppose your windowing software only allows windows to be resized in such
a way that their aspect ratios are unmodified.  For example, a window with
a width
of 150 pixels and a height of 100 pixels (and an aspect ratio of 150/100,
or 1.5)
can be resized so its width is 225 pixels and its height is 150 pixels
(the aspect ratio
remains unchanged, at 225/150, or 1.5), but a width of 224 and a height
of 150 is not
allowed, since that would change the aspect ratio.  Each window can be
moved to an
arbitrary location on the screen, but the entire window must remain visible
on the screen.

<p>

<p>
<br>
Given the size of a screen and the initial sizes of four different windows
(as integer values for width and height), is it possible to resize (and
relocate) the
four windows so they completely cover the screen without overlapping each
other?
That's the question you are to answer in this problem.

<p>

<p>
<br>
For example, consider a square screen with four square windows.
The aspect ratio
for each of these is exactly 1.  We are permitted to resize each of
the four windows
so they would completely fill the screen without overlapping.
This case is illustrated by the first data set in the Sample Input, below.

<p>

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
Input will consist of one or more data sets followed by a pair of zeroes.
Each data set will contain five pairs of integers.  The first pair


(<i>W</i><sub><i>s</i></sub>, <i>H</i><sub><i>s</i></sub>) specifies the
width and height of the screen.  The four remaining pairs (<i>W</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>,
<i>H</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>, for <i>i</i> = 1 to 4) specify the initial sizes of the windows.

<p>

<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">
Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
Output should have one line for each input data set.  The line should contain
the input data set number (starting with 1) followed by the word <tt>Yes</tt>
if the screen can be completely covered by the (possibly resized and relocated) windows with no overlap, or <tt>No</tt> if it cannot be so covered.
