<p>
In a Duckpin Tournament, the winner is decided by the player with the highest 
number of tournament points earned by playing a number of <em>matches</em>. Points are
awarded for winning a match and scoring the highest game during the match.  A 
<em>duckpin match</em> consists of a series of three <em>lines</em>, or games. The match winner is
the player with the highest series score, i.e., three game total.  The high game 
winner is the player with the highest score for a single line during the match.

<p>

<p>
<br>
A <em>line of duckpins</em> is divided into ten <em>frames</em>.  In each frame a player has
three tries to knock down ten duckpins with a ball. If the player knocks down
all ten pins on the first try, a strike is awarded and the frame is concluded
(see exception below).
If the player knocks down all ten pins in two tries, a spare is awarded and the 
frame is concluded (see exception below). If during any of the three tries
a foul is committed by the player crossing the foul line, the frame is concluded
and only the pins knocked down prior to that try are counted for the frame.

<p>
The points earned
in a frame equal the number of pins knocked down plus any bonus points earned 
for a spare or a strike. The bonus points earned for a spare or strike equal the
number of pins knocked down on the next try following a spare or on the next two 
tries following a strike.  A foul following a spare or strike earns zero bonus
points unless the foul occurs on the second try following a strike; then only
the bonus points earned on the first try are counted.

<p>
A spare or a strike
normally concludes the frame.  However, if a spare or a strike occurs in the
tenth frame, the frame is concluded by the player immediately taking the
appropriate number of tries to earn the bonus points. The score for each frame
equals the number of points awarded for the frame plus the score in the
previous frame.

<p>

<p>
<br>
Write a program to produce a scoring summary for one or more duckpin matches 
of one to four players.

<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">
Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
The input for each match consists of an integer indicating
the number of players, a list of players' names (each name is a max. length of 10 
alpha characters), followed by lines of integers representing the number of pins 
knocked down by each player on the first, second, or third try in each game in the 
match.  The match is concluded by `<tt>#</tt>'.  The input is concluded when the number
of players for a match is zero.

<p>
Since each match consists of three games and each player gets three tries per 
frame in each game, the total number of lines of integers in the match will be nine 
times the number of players.  The players play in the order that the names were 
listed.  The order of the lines is:

<p>
<dl compact="">
<dt>1.
<dd>three lines for the first player in the first game
followed by three lines for each of the other players for the first game,
<dt>2.
<dd>three lines for the first player in the second game followed by three
lines for each of the other players for the second game,
<dt>3.
<dd>similarly for the third game with the match concluded by `<tt>#</tt>'.
</dd></dt></dd></dt></dd></dt></dl>

<p>
The line of integers representing the first try will have at least
ten integers but no more than twelve.  Since a second or third try may not be 
attempted in a frame, the second and third lines may have less than ten integers.

<p>
A negative integer indicates the number of pins knocked down however the player
fouled on the try.

Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
The output shows a frame by frame score for each player for each game in the 
match.  Each line of output consists of the player's name, left justified in a field ten 
characters wide, and ten integers, right justified with a field four characters wide.  
At the end of the match report the match and high game winner followed by a 
blank line. 
<p>
No two players will get the same high score.
