Turing Machine</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
<i>Turing Machine</i> (TM) was defined by mathematician Alan Turing in
1936. You probably expect all the Contest problems to be related to the
same topic, so you may now wonder what the Turing Machine has in common
with the Antique Theatre. The fact is that Alan Turing had a friend called
Fred. And Fred's Grandmother was keen on Antique Tragedies. So we think
it is a good idea to give you this problem as a remembrance of Alan Turing.
<p>Let us describe one particular TM: TM consists of two-way potentially
infinite <i>tape</i>, read/write <i>head</i> and a <i>finite automaton</i>
control unit. The tape is an infinite one-dimensional sequence of <i>fields</i>.
Each field contains one symbol of an <i>alphabet</i> <i>Sigma = {~,0,1,...,M}</i>,
where '~' is a special <i>blank</i> symbol. At each moment, there is just
a finite number of fields not containing the blank symbol.
<p>The head is a device capable at each step of reading one symbol from
the tape field above which it is positioned, writing another symbol on
its place and moving one field to the left or right. As the tape is two-way
potentially infinite, the movement is always possible.
<p>The control unit drives the head. At each time, it is in one state taken
from <i>Gamma = {0,1,...,N}</i>. It starts in state <i>0</i>. At each step
the control unit considers its actual state <i>gamma</i> and the symbol
under the head <i>sigma</i>. This information determines the symbol to
be written on the tape <i>sigma'</i> in place of <i>sigma</i>, the next
state to go <i>gamma'</i> and the direction <i>delta</i> (<tt>R</tt> or
<tt>L</tt>
for right or left) for the movement of the head.
<p>TM description (TMD) is a triple <i>(M,N,P)</i> where <i>P</i> is a
set of rules. Each rule is a quintuple <i>(gamma, sigma, sigma', gamma',
delta)</i> describing the behaviour of the machine in a particular situation
as described in the preceding paragraph. If no rule exists for the current
situation, the machine stops, i.e. the calculation is finished. Conflicting
(with the same <i>gamma</i> and <i>sigma</i>) rules may not exist.
<p>In the text form, TMD starts with a line containing positive integers
<i>M</i>
and <i>N</i>. Then there is an arbitrary number of lines containing each
one rule. The rule is described as <i>gamma sigma sigma' gamma' delta</i>,
where <i>gamma, sigma, sigma'</i> and <i>gamma'</i> are integers ('~' should
be coded as <tt>-1</tt> and <i>delta from {<tt>R</tt>, <tt>L</tt>}</i>,
the symbols are separated by spaces. After the last rule, a line immediately
follows which contains only the symbol '<tt>-</tt>'.
<p>When the machine starts there will be a finite string of symbols from
<i>Sigma</i>
starting under the head position and continuing to the right. All the remaining
fields on the tape are blank.
<p>Theoretically, TM is equivalent to any general purpose computer. We
ask you to at least partly demonstrate it --- you are to write a program
generating TMD evaluating arbitrary Turing arithmetic expression (TAE)
for any input values. TAE is defined in the following section.
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">
Turing Arithmetic Expression</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
TAE is defined by the following grammar:
<ul>
<li>
<i>TAE</i> -> <i>expr</i></li>

<li>
<i>expr</i> -> <i>factor</i> | <i>expr</i> <tt>+</tt> <i>expr</i></li>

<li>
<i>factor</i> -> <tt>(</tt> <i>expr</i> <tt>)</tt> | <i>factor</i> <tt>*</tt><i>factor</i>
| <i>variable</i></li>

<li>
<i>variable</i> -> <tt>1</tt> | <tt>2</tt> | ... | <tt>9</tt></li>
</ul>
The operators <tt>+</tt> resp. <tt>*</tt> operators stand for integer addition
resp. multiplication modulo 10 (e.g. <i>238*17=6</i>); multiplication takes
precedence over addition. The syntactic element <i>variable</i> denotes
the value of the first, second, etc. up to ninth integer written on the
tape of the TM at start time.
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">
Task</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
Write a program that for each TAE outputs a TMD evaluating the TAE for
any valid contents of the tape. A valid contents of the tape is a sequence
of at most nine non-negative integers written left to write (most significant
digit first) in a decimal notation using symbols <tt>0</tt>, ..., <tt>9</tt>
and separated by one blank symbol. All the rest of the tape is blank, the
head starts at the most significant digit of the first number. The magnitude
of the integers is not specified. Example of a valid tape (underline indicates
head position):
<center><pre>... ~ ~ ~ ~ <u>1</u> 2 3 ~ 4 7 ~ 1 1 ~ ~ ~ ~ ...</pre></center>
When the TM finished processing the tape should contain the result of the
computation starting with the most significant digit under the head and
continuing to the right until the first blank. No leading zeros are allowed.
The contents of the rest of the tape is insignificant. For example, if
the TAE was <tt>(1+3)*2</tt> and the tape contents as above, the correct
answer would be <i>(123+11).47 mod 10 = 8</i>. The correct tape contents
would be
<center><pre>x x x <u>8</u> ~ x x x</pre></center>
where <i>x</i> stands for any symbol.
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">
Input Specification</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
The input consists of <i>N</i> cases. The first line of the input contains
only positive integer <i>N</i>. Then follow the cases. Each case is described
by one line, containing one valid TAE. The line is at most 1000 characters
long, does not contain any characters other than <tt>0</tt>, <tt>1</tt>,
..., <tt>9</tt>, <tt>(</tt>, <tt>)</tt>, <tt>*</tt> and <tt>+</tt>, and
is terminated by the newline character.
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">
Output Specification</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
For each case, print valid TMD that evaluates the TAE for any valid tape
contents. You can assume there will be always at least as many integers
on the tape, as mentioned in the TAE.
<p><i>Remark:</i> For this problem, 'Presentation error' is returned if
your program did not generate a valid TMD, while 'Wrong answer' means that
the generated TMD was valid but the corresponding TM did not produce the
correct output.
