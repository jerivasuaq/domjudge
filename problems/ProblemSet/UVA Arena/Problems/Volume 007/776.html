<p>
Consider the situation of an ideal forest, where trees grow on a regular finite euclidean lattice.
At every site only one tree grows, and it can be of one among <i>n</i> species. Each species is
denoted by a single character ({

<img width="88" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="776img1.gif" alt="$A, B, C, \dots$">} are valid species, for instance). Two trees of
the same species are considered neighbors if the maximum absolute difference between their
coordinates is one.

<p>
Families of (rather specialized) monkeys are released, one at a time, in this euclidean
forest. Each family will occupy all neighboring tress of a single species which have not been
taken yet by another family. The monkeys are released from left to right and from top to bottom.

<p>
Given the map of the forest, build the map of the monkeys families, starting with ``1''
and numbering them consecutively.

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
Input file has the lines of a matrix of single characters, separated by single blank spaces.

<p>
Next matrices (each matrix is a different instance to the problem) will be preceded by a
line with a single ``<tt>%</tt>'' character and then the same structure as before.

<p>

<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">
Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
Output file has to show lines of integers separated by as many blank spaces as required
to align columns to the right.

<p>
The solution to each instance must be finished by a line with a single ``<tt>%</tt>'' character.
