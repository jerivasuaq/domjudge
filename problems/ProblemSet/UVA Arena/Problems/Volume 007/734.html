The Puzzle</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>
The goal of this problem is to solve a puzzle that consists of 7
hexagonally-shaped pieces of wood (from now on referred to simply
as `hexagons') that can be placed on 7 pegs that are mounted on a
wooden base.  The pegs are arranged in the pattern shown in Figure
1.  Notice that we have numbered the pegs (0 through 6) in order
to facilitate this discussion. The hexagons are labeled with the
capital letters 'A' through 'G' (see figure 2 for one example). An
integer (between 0 and 9, inclusive) is printed adjacent to each
edge of each hexagon.

<p>
You will notice that when 7 hexagons are placed on the 7 pegs that
3 edges of each  of the outer hexagons and all edges of the
hexagon on peg 0 are adjacent to an edge  of some other hexagon.
In order to solve the puzzle you must find an arrangement and
orientation of all 7 hexagons so that the numbers associated with
each edge  that is adjacent to some other edge equals the number
associated with that other edge. (See Figure 3).

Program Description</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>
The program must read a description of seven hexagons from the
input file, find a solution to the puzzle using those 7 hexagons
(if one exists), and write to the output file a description of the
puzzle's solution. If more than one solution exists, you may
choose any one of them (Obviously, once a solution is found, one
could rotate the hexagon on peg 0 and move the other hexagons
around to find other closely-related solutions.) If no solution
exists, your program should report same by writing an appropriate
message to the output file. After solving the puzzle for one set
of hexagon solutions, your program should read the next set, solve
the new puzzle, and continue until the end-of-file is detected in
the input file.

<p>

<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001003000000000000000">
Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>
As stated above the input file contains several sets of hexagon
descriptions.  The first 7 lines in the file contain 6 digits on
each line (no spaces). These digits represent the integers that
are printed on the 6 sides of each hexagon. The first line
contains the integers printed on the hexagon labeled 'A'.  The
second line corresponds to hexagon 'B', and so forth through line
7 that corresponds to hexagon 'G'.  The first digit on each line
corresponds to the integer printed on the edge that is initially
in the ``12 O'Clock" position that we'll call ``TOP".  The next 5
digits are the numbers on the edges as you proceed in a clockwise
fashion from the edge that is ``TOP". For example the hexagon in
figure 2 on the previous page could be represented by the data
line: <tt>123456</tt>.  As you can see in figure 3, the edges of a
given hexagon do NOT necessarily have unique integers.

<p>

<p>
<br>
After the 7 lines that describe a given set of hexagons, there is
a line that contains a single asterisk (<tt>*</tt>) in column 1 which
is used as a delimiter between sets of hexagon. After finding a
solution for the current set of hexagons, and until the
end-of-file is detected, your program should read the next 7 lines
that represent a new set of hexagons and a new puzzle that should
be solved. The asterisk follows every set, including the final
one.

<p>

<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001004000000000000000">
Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>
The output file should contain a description of a solution for
each set of hexagons given in the input file.  A solution
description consists of reporting which hexagon should be placed
on peg 0, peg 1, peg 2, ... and peg 6.  In addition it is
necessary that the report describe the orientation of each
hexagon.  Thus the output should consists of a 3 column report.
Column 1 is a list of the pegs 0 through 6.  Column 2 is a list of
the letters that represent the hexagons that should be placed on
peg 0, peg 1, ... and peg 6, in that order. Column 3 is a list of
the edge numbers for the hexagon listed in column 2.  The digits
should begin with the edge that is in the ``TOP" position when the
puzzle is solved.  The next 5 digits should correspond to the
edges as you proceed in a clockwise fashion.  Each column should
have a heading. The first column's heading should be ``<tt>PEG</tt>".
The heading for column 2 should be ``<tt>HEX</tt>".  The third
heading should be ``<tt>POSITION</tt>".

<p>

<p>
<br>
If there is no solution for a particular set of hexagons, print
the message: ``<tt>No solution possible</tt>". Write a line of 36
asterisks ``<tt>*</tt>" to the output file after each solution
description (or ``No solution" message) in order to separate the
output for one puzzle from the next.
