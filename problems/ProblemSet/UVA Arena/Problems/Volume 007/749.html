<p>
A system is composed of 1, 2, or 3 machines and a repairman responsible for
maintaining these machines. Normally, the machines are running and producing
a product. At random points in time, the machines fail and are fixed by the
repairman. If a second or third machine fails while the repairman is busy
fixing the first machine, these machines will wait on the services of the
repairman in a first come, first served order. When repair on a machine is
complete, the machine will begin running again and producing a product. The
repairman will then repair the next machine waiting. When all machines are
running, the repairman becomes idle.

<p>
Write a program that will simulate this system for a fixed period of time and
calculate the fraction of time the machines are busy (utilization) and the
fraction of time the repairman is busy (utilization). Machines are busy when
producing parts and the repairman is busy when repairing machines.

Input and Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
The input file is composed of three parts each separated by a header record.
The first part is a list of 50 random machine running times until failure.
The second part is a list of 50 random machine repair times. The third part
is a list of the cases to be simulated. Each case specifies the length of
the simulation and the number of machines assigned to the repairman. Cases
end with the specification of a 0 length and an assignment of 0 machines.
Each case will use the same random machine running times and repair times,
starting at the beginning.

<p>
A sample input file and the corresponding output file (print results accurately rounded to 3
decimal places) is provided below. Diagrams are also provided to illustrate
the simulation process.
