<p>
As chief engineer of the Starship Interprize, the task of repairing the
hyperstellar, cubic, transwarped-out software has fallen on your shoulders.
Simply put, you must compute the volume of the intersection of anywhere from 2
to 1000 cubes.

<p>

Input and Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
The input data file consists of several sets of cubes for which
the volume of their intersections must be computed. The first line
of the data file contains a number (from 2 to 1000) which
indicates the number of cubes which follow, one cube per line.
Each line which describes a cube contains four integers. The first
three integers are the <i>x</i>, <i>y</i> and <i>z</i> coordinates of the corner
of a cube, and the fourth integer is the positive distance which
the cube extends in each of the three directions (parallel to the
x, y, and z axes) from that corner.

<p>

<p>
<br>
Following the data for the first set of cubes will be a number which indicates
how many cubes are in a second set, followed by the cube descriptions for the
second set, again one per line.  Following this will be a third set, and so on.
Your program should continue to process sets of cubes, outputting the volume of
their intersections to the output file, one set per line, until a zero is read
for the number of cubes.

<p>

<p>
<br>
Note that the data file will always contain at least one set of cubes, and
every set will contain at least 2 and at most 1000 cubes. For any given set of
cubes, the volume of their intersections will not exceed 1,000,000 units.
