<p>
Editors of an electronic magazine make draft versions of the documents in 
the form of text files.
However, publications should meet some requirements, in particular, 
concerning the rules of
reference use. Unfortunately, lots of the draft articles violate some 
rules. It is desirable to develop a
computer program that will make a publication satisfy all the rules 
from a draft version.

<p>

<p>
<br>
Let's call a ``paragraph" a set of lines in the article going one after 
another, so that paragraphs are
separated by at least one empty line (an ``empty line" is a line that 
containing no characters different
from spaces). Any paragraph can contain an arbitrary number of references. 
A reference is a
positive integer not greater than 999 enclosed in square brackets 
(for example: [23]). There will be
no spaces between the brackets and the number. The square brackets 
are not used in any other
context but reference.

<p>

<p>
<br>
There can be two types of paragraph - ``regular" and 
``reference description". Reference description
differs from the regular paragraph because it begins with the 
reference it describes, for example:

<p>
<pre>
[23] It is the description ...
</pre>

<p>
The opening square bracket will be at the first position of the
first line of the ``reference description" paragraph (i.e. there
will be no spaces before it). No reference description paragraph
will contain references inside itself.

<p>
Each reference will have
exactly one corresponding description and each description will
have at least one reference to it.

<p>
To convert a draft version to a
publication you have to use the following rules.

<p>
<ul>
<li>References should
be renumbered by the successive integer numbers starting from one
in the order of their first appearance in the regular paragraphs
of the source draft version of the document.
<li>Reference
descriptions should be placed at the end of the article ordered by
their number.
<li>The order of ``regular" paragraphs in the document
should be preserved.
<li>Your program should not make any other
changes to the paragraphs.
</li></li></li></li></ul>

<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">
Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
The input file will be a text file containing a draft article your program 
should process. All lines
will be no more than 80 characters long. Any reference description will 
contain no more than 3
lines. The input file will contain up to 40000 lines.

<p>

<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">
Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
The output file contains the result of processing. All paragraphs should 
be separated by one ``true"
empty line (i.e. a line that contains no characters at all). There should 
be no empty lines before the
first paragraph.

The Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP) [10] (through the extensions
defined in the Dynamic RARP (DRARP) [5]) explicitly addresses the problem of
network address discovery, and includes an automatic IP address assignment
mechanism.

        Address Resolution Protocol", RFC 903, Stanford, June 1984.

        USC/Information Sciences Institute, September 1981.

The Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) [20] provides for transport of a boot
image from a boot server. The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) [16] provides 
for informing hosts of additional routers via "ICMP redirect" messages.
