<p>
In chess it is possible to place eight queens on the board so that no one
queen can be taken by any other. Write a program that will determine all
such possible arrangements for eight queens given the initial position of one
of the queens.

<p>
Do not attempt to write a program which evaluates every possible 8
configuration of 8 queens placed on the board. This would require 8<sup>8</sup>
evaluations and would bring the system to its knees. There will be a
reasonable run time constraint placed on your program.

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
The first line of the input contains the number of datasets, and it's followed by a blank line.
Each dataset
will be two numbers separated by a blank. The numbers represent the square
on which one of the eight queens must be positioned. A valid square will be
represented; it will not be necessary to validate the input.

<p>
To standardize our notation, assume that the upper left-most corner of the
board is position (1,1). Rows run horizontally and the top row is row 1.
Columns are vertical and column 1 is the left-most column. Any reference to
a square is by row then column; thus square (4,6) means row 4, column 6.

<p>Each dataset is separated by a blank line.

Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
Output for each dataset will consist of a one-line-per-solution representation.

<p>
Each solution will be sequentially numbered <img width="55" height="15" align="BOTTOM" border="0" src="750img1.gif" alt="$1 \dots N$">.
Each solution will
consist of 8 numbers. Each of the 8 numbers will be the ROW coordinate for
that solution. The column coordinate will be indicated by the order in which
the 8 numbers are printed. That is, the first number represents the ROW in
which the queen is positioned in column 1; the second number represents the
ROW in which the queen is positioned in column 2, and so on.

<p>
The sample input below produces 4 solutions. The full 8<img width="18" height="30" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="750img2.gif" alt="$\times$">8 representation of each solution is shown below.

<p>
Submit only the one-line, 8 digit representation of each solution as described
earlier. Solution #1 below indicates that there is a queen at Row 1, Column 1;
Row 5, Column 2; Row 8, Column 3; Row 6, Column 4; Row 3,Column 5; ... Row 4,
Column 8.

<p>
Include the two lines of column headings as shown below in the sample output and print the solutions in lexicographical order.

<p>Print a blank line between datasets.
