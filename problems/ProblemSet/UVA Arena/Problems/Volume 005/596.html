A <em>simple polygon</em> is a polygon that contains no self-intersecting lines.  A <em>convex polygon</em> is a simple 
polygon with all internal angles less than 180 degrees.  For a set of two-dimensional objects, their 
<em>convex hull</em> is the convex polygon of least area that completely encloses all of the objects.  In the figure 
below, the three solid-lined objects on the left are enclosed in a dotted-line convex polygon, but that 
polygon is not their convex hull; on the right the same three objects are enclosed by their convex hull.

<p>
Determining the convex hull of a set of objects is a fundamental problem in both computer graphics and
computational geometry.  The object of this problem is to write a program that will report the convex 
hull of a set of simple polygons.  An input file will define several such sets of polygons for which convex 
hulls should be reported in the output file.

<p>

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>
Each line of the input file will begin with either the letter `<tt>S</tt>', the letter `<tt>P</tt>', or the word `<tt>END</tt>'.  Lines 
starting with `<tt>S</tt>' begin a new set of polygons.  Lines starting with `<tt>P</tt>' define a polygon in the current 
set.  The word `<tt>END</tt>' will appear only as the last line of the input file.

<p>

<p>
<br>
Each `<tt>S</tt>' starting a line will be followed by a single space and then a character string which identifies the 
set of polygons.  Each `<tt>P</tt>' starting a line will be followed by a single space and then  a list of integers 
delimited by single spaces.  The first integer specifies the number of vertices in the polygon, and the 
remaining integers specify, in counterclockwise order, the (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) coordinates of each polygon vertex.

<p>

<p>
<br>
Each set of polygons will contain from 1 to 20 simple polygons.  Each polygon will contain from 3 to 
20 distinct vertices.  Each vertex will be an integer coordinate in the range (-1000,-1000) to 
(1000,1000).  No input polygon will have more than two adjacent collinear points, that is a point will 
not occur on an edge between two other points.

<p>

<p>
<br>
It may be assumed that all input will be syntactically correct.

<p>

<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">
Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>
Two lines should be output for each set of polygons.  The first line should start with the character string 
from the input file which identifies the polygon set, followed by the characters ``<tt> convex hull:</tt>".  
The second line should list the coordinates of the vertices in the convex hull, each vertex being preceded 
by a single space and in the format ``(<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>)", where <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are the integer coordinates of the vertex.  
The output of the convex hull vertices should begin with the vertex with the largest <i>x</i>-coordinate, ties 
being resolved by the selecting the smaller <i>y</i>-coordinate.  The vertices of the convex hull should be 
output in counterclockwise order.

<p>

<p>
<br>
Any vertex that is part of an input polygon that is also part of the convex hull should appear in the 
output.  That is to say points should not be eliminated from the convex hull to prevent more than two 
adjacent points on the hull from being collinear.  For example, supposing that (10,1), (10,7) and (10,12) 
are consecutive points on the convex hull, the point (10,7) should not be removed but rather reported as 
part of the convex hull.
