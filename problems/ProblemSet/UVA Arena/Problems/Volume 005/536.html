<p>
Little Valentine liked playing with binary trees very much. Her favorite
game was constructing
randomly looking binary trees with capital letters in the nodes.

<p>
This is an example of one of her creations:

<p>
<pre>
                                    D
                                   / \
                                  /   \
                                 B     E
                                / \     \
                               /   \     \ 
                              A     C     G
                                         /
                                        /
                                       F
</pre>

<p>
To record her trees for future generations, she wrote down two strings
for each tree: a preorder
traversal (root, left subtree, right subtree) and an inorder traversal
(left subtree, root, right subtree).

<p>
For the tree drawn above the preorder traversal is <tt>DBACEGF</tt> and the
inorder traversal is <tt>ABCDEFG</tt>.

<p>
She thought that such a pair of strings would give enough information to
reconstruct the tree later (but she never tried it).

<p>

<p>
<br>
Now, years later, looking again at the strings, she realized that
reconstructing the trees was indeed
possible, but only because she never had used the same letter twice
in the same tree.

<p>
However, doing the reconstruction by hand, soon turned out to be tedious.

<p>
So now she asks you to write a program that does the job for her!

<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">
Input Specification</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
The input file will contain one or more test cases.
Each test case consists of one line containing two strings preord and
inord, representing the
preorder traversal and inorder traversal of a binary tree. Both strings
consist of unique capital
letters. (Thus they are not longer than 26 characters.)

<p>
Input is terminated by end of file.

<p>

<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">
Output Specification</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
For each test case, recover Valentine's binary tree and print one line
containing the tree's postorder
traversal (left subtree, right subtree, root).
