<p>
Many games, such as Bridge, involve dealing a standard deck of 52 cards to 4
players, so each
receives 13 cards. Good players can then play with the hand as it is dealt,
but most ordinary players
will need to sort it, firstly by suit, and then by rank within suit.

<p>

<p>
<br>
There is no fixed ranking of the suits for this purpose, but it is useful to
alternate the colours, so we
will presume the following ordering: CLUBS &lt; DIAMONDS &lt; SPADES &lt; HEARTS.
(Note that
from now on we will use the more conventional <tt>C</tt>, <tt>D</tt>, <tt>S</tt>, <tt>H</tt>). Within a suit Ace is high, so the
ordering is <tt>2 </tt>&lt;<tt> 3 </tt>&lt;<tt> 4 </tt>&lt;<tt> 5 </tt>&lt;<tt> 6 </tt>&lt;<tt> 7 </tt>&lt;<tt> 8 </tt>&lt;<tt> 9 </tt>&lt;<tt> T </tt>&lt;<tt> J </tt>&lt;<tt> Q </tt>&lt;<tt> K </tt>&lt;<tt> A</tt>.

<p>

<p>
<br>
The players are usually designated North, South, East and West, and they sit
at the points of the
compass they name. One player is designated the dealer and he (or she) deals
one card to each
player starting with the player on his (her) left hand and proceeding
clockwise until he (she) deals the last card to himself (herself).

Write a program that will read in a presentation of a deck of cards, deal them,
sort them, and then display the 4 sorted hands in the format shown below.

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
Input will consist of a series of deals. Each deal will consist of the letter
representing the dealer (<tt>N</tt>,
<tt>E</tt>, <tt>S</tt>, <tt>W</tt>) followed by two lines representing the deck as shown below. The file
will be terminated by a line consisting of a single '<tt>#</tt>'.

<p>

<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">
Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
Output will consist of a series of sets of four lines, one set for each deal.
Each set will consist of
four lines displaying the sorted hands, in the order and format shown below.
Sets must follow each
other immediately, with no blank line between them.
