Wou will probably have made a document on a word processor. When the job was
done and you
wanted to print that document you sometimes have the option to print the
document with
proportional spacing. This means that gaps between letters and words are
filled with very small
spaces (as small as your printer can handle) in such a way that you do not
see a ragged appearance
of a line but instead the line is left and right justified on your printout.
This could also be done by
filling each line with normal spaces, but this usually produces big gaps
between words. In the following we call these small spaces <b>dots</b>.

<p>

<p>
<br>
In the exercise you are asked to produce an algorithm that fills lines with
dots in such a manner that
the line has a certain length (measured in dots). We will provide you with
lines which contain
spaces and certain letters. Each character has a width that can be measured
in dots. In order to keep
this exercise simple we will only use a subset of letters. These letters are
the following:

<p>
<div align="CENTER">
<table cellpadding="3">
<tr><td align="CENTER"><b> Character</b></td>
<td align="CENTER"><b> Width</b></td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="CENTER">A</td>
<td align="CENTER">18</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="CENTER">B</td>
<td align="CENTER">17</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="CENTER">I</td>
<td align="CENTER">10</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="CENTER">M</td>
<td align="CENTER">20</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="CENTER">S</td>
<td align="CENTER">16</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="CENTER">Y</td>
<td align="CENTER">13</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="CENTER">`space'</td>
<td align="CENTER">Variable</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

<p>
The minimum number of dots between letters in a word is 3. The number of dots
that separates letters in a word is given by the greatest <b>possible</b> number that is equal to or smaller than 1/3 of the minimum number of dots that separate words (rounded down to the nearest integer).
The minimum
number of dots for a single space is 10(there is no upper limit for the number
of dots in a space).

<p>

<p>
<br>

<b>Note:</b> the begin and end of a line may not contain (empty) dots.

<p>

<p>
<br>
It can (and according to Murphy's law it will) happen that you are left with
a number of dots that
can't be equally divided in the gaps between letters or words. These leftovers
must be equally
divided over the spaces between the words beginning from the end of the line.

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
The input for your program is a text-file. Each input consists of two lines.
On the first line there is
an integer (say <i>N</i>) that tells you the desired length of the line (measured in
dots) that will be your
output. This integer has a maximum value of 5000. The second line consists of
the input that you
have to reformat to the desired length (each word is separated from the other
by one space). Each
line has at least two words on it and the maximum number of characters on
this line is 80. There are
no spaces after the last word. It is given that it is possible to fill the
given line with dots so that the
resulting line has a length of <i>N</i> dots. The last two lines of the input are
given by:

<p>
<pre>

SYMIBA
</pre>

<p>
Your program must not perform any action on this last input, it is simply
there to mark the end of the input.

<p>

<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">
Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
Your program must convert the given line to the desired length (<i>N</i> dots). The
output is a text-file.
Each line corresponds to the second line of each input pair with the number
of dots between the
letters and words. The spaces between letters and words are denoted in a
special manner. If there
are 3 dots between the letters <tt>A</tt> and <tt>B</tt> this is denoted by <tt>A/(3)B</tt> in your output. Your output may
not contain any spaces, all these spaces must be converted to dots.
