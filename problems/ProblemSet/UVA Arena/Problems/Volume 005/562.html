It's commonly known that the Dutch have invented copper-wire. Two Dutch men
were fighting over a nickel, which was made of copper. They were both so
eager to get it and the fighting was so fierce, they stretched the coin to
great length and thus created copper-wire.

<p>

<p>
<br>
Not commonly known is that the fighting started, after the two Dutch tried to
 divide a bag with coins between the two of them. The contents of the bag
 appeared not to be equally divisible. The Dutch of the past couldn't stand
 the fact that a division
 should favour one of them and they always wanted a fair share to the very
last cent. Nowadays fighting over a single cent will not be seen anymore, but
being capable of making an equal division as fair as possible is something
that will remain important forever...

<p>

<p>
<br>
That's what this whole problem is about. Not everyone is capable of seeing
instantly what's the most fair division of a bag of coins between two persons.
Your help is asked to solve this problem.

<p>

<p>
<br>
Given a bag with a maximum of 100 coins, determine the most fair division
between two persons. This means that the difference between the amount each
person obtains should be minimised. The value of a coin varies from 1 cent
to 500 cents. It's not allowed to split a single coin.

<p>

A line with the number of problems <i>n</i>, followed by <i>n</i> times:
<ul>
<li>a line with a non negative integer <i>m</i> (<img width="69" height="30" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="562img1.gif" alt="$m \le 100$">)
indicating the number of coins in the bag
<li>a line with <i>m</i> numbers separated by one space, each number indicates the
 value of a coin.
</li></li></ul>

<p>

<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">
Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
The output consists of <i>n</i> lines. Each line contains the minimal positive
difference between the amount the two persons obtain when they divide the
coins from the corresponding bag.
