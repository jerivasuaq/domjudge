<p>
Freddy Frog is sitting on a stone in the middle of a lake. Suddenly he notices
Fiona Frog who is
sitting on another stone. He plans to visit her, but since the water is
dirty and full of tourists'
sunscreen, he wants to avoid swimming and instead reach her by jumping.

<p>
Unfortunately Fiona's stone is out of his jump range. Therefore Freddy
considers to use other
stones as intermediate stops and reach her by a sequence of several
small jumps.

<p>
To execute a given sequence of jumps, a frog's jump range obviously must
be at least as long as the longest jump occuring in the sequence.

<p>
The <em>frog distance</em> (humans also call it <em>minimax distance</em>) between two stones therefore is defined as
the minimum necessary jump range over all possible paths between the
two stones.

<p>

<p>
<br>
You are given the coordinates of Freddy's stone, Fiona's stone and all other stones in the lake. Your
job is to compute the 
frog distance between Freddy's and Fiona's stone.

Input Specification</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
The input file will contain one or more test cases. The first line of
each test case will contain the
number of stones <i>n</i> (

<img width="96" height="30" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="534img1.gif" alt="$2 \le n \le 200$">). The next <i>n</i> lines each contain two
integers <i>x</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>, <i>y</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> (

<img width="132" height="30" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="534img2.gif" alt="$0 \le x_i,y_i \le 1000$">)
representing the coordinates of stone #<i>i</i>. Stone #1 is Freddy's stone,
stone #2 is Fiona's stone,
the other <i>n</i>-2 stones are unoccupied. There's a blank line following each test
case. Input is terminated by a value of zero (0) for <i>n</i>.

<p>

<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">
Output Specification</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
For each test case, print a line saying ``<tt>Scenario #</tt><i>x</i>" and a line
saying ``<tt>Frog Distance = </tt><i>y</i>" where <i>x</i>
is replaced by the test case number (they are numbered from 1) and <i>y</i> is
replaced by the appropriate
real number, printed to three decimals. Put a blank line after each
test case, even after the last one.
