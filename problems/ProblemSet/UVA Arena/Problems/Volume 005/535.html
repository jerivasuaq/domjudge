<p>
As a member of an ACM programming team you'll soon find yourself always
traveling around the
world: Z&#252;rich, Philadelphia, San Jos&#233;, Atlanta,... from 1999 on the
Contest Finals even will be on a
different continent each year, so one day you might get to Japan or Australia.

<p>
At the contest site it would be interesting to know how many miles you
are away from home. For
this sake, your job is to write a program to compute the geographical distance
between two given
locations on the Earth's surface.

<p>
We assume that the Earth is a perfect sphere with a radius of exactly 6378 km.
The geographical
distance between A and B is the length of the geodetic line segment
connecting A and B.

<p>
The geodetic line segment between two points on a sphere is the shortest
connecting curve lying
entirely in the surface of the sphere.

<p>
The value of pi (<img width="15" height="15" align="BOTTOM" border="0" src="535img1.gif" alt="$\pi$">)
is approximately 3.141592653589793.

Input Specification</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
The input file will consist of two parts: a list of cities and a list of
queries.

<p>

<p>
<br>

<b>City List</b>

<p>
The city list consists of up to 100 lines, one line per city.
Each line will contain a string <i>c</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> and two
real numbers <i>lat</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> and <i>long</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>, representing the city name, its latitude and
its longitude, respectively.

<p>
The city name will be shorter than 30 characters and will not contain
white-space characters.
The latitude will be between -90 (South Pole) and +90 (North Pole). The
longitude will be between
-180 and +180 where negative numbers denote locations west of the meridian
and positive numbers
denote locations east of the meridian. (The meridian passes through Greenwich,
London.)

<p>
The city list will be terminated by a line consisting of a single ``<tt>#</tt>".

<p>

<p>
<br>

<b>Query List</b>

<p>
Each line will contain two city names <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>.

<p>
The query list will be terminated by the line ``<tt># #</tt>".

<p>

<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">
Output Specification</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
For each query, print a line saying ``<i>A</i> <tt>-</tt> <i>B</i>" where <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are replaced by
the city names. Then print
a line saying ``<i>x</i> <tt>km</tt>" where <i>x</i> is replaced by the geographical distance (in km) between the two cities, rounded to the nearest integer.

<p>
If one of the cities in the query didn't occur in the city list, print a line saying ``<tt>Unknown</tt>" instead.

<p>
