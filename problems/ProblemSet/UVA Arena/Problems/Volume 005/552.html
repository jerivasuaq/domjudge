<p>
At the largest conference on coding and cryptography the following theorem
needed a proof or a counterexample: Suppose you are given a set of words
of equal length; each word consisting of <tt>0</tt>'s, <tt>1</tt>'s and/or <tt>*</tt>'s. Furthermore
suppose the pattern of <tt>*</tt>'s is different for all words in the set. By this
we mean: if you replace all <tt>0</tt>'s and <tt>1</tt>'s by say <tt>$</tt> you obtain different words.

<p>

<p>
<br>
The claim is: if you replace the <tt>*</tt>'s by <tt>0</tt>'s and <tt>1</tt>'s in all possible ways, then you obtain a set that is at least as big as the set you started with.

<p>

<p>
<br>
Example:

<p>
<tt>{ 10*, *0*, *00 }</tt> produces <tt>{ 100, 101, 000, 001 }</tt>

<p>
<tt>{ 100, 101, 10* }</tt> produces <tt>{ 100, 101 }</tt>

<p>

<p>
<br>
Notice that the set in the latter example does not satisfy the condidtion
mentioned above, so it does not provide a counterexample.

<p>

<p>
<br>
You program has to check for a number of cases:

<p>
<dl compact="">
<dt>1.
<dd>Whether the pattern of <tt>*</tt>'s is different for all words in the set and:
<dt>2.
<dd>Compute the number of words obtained by replacing the <tt>*</tt>'s by <tt>0</tt>'s and <tt>1</tt>'s.
</dd></dt></dd></dt></dl>

<p>
The words will not be longer than 15 symbols.

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
The input is a text-file that presents a sequence of sets. Each set is
described as follows. The first line gives two integers: the length of the
words and the number of the words. Then follow the words, each on a separate
line. The end of the sequence of sets is indicated by a set with wordlength
0 and number of words equal to 0.

<p>

<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">
Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
The output is a textfile that contains one line for each set. if the pattern
of <tt>*</tt>'s is different for all the words in this set this line should contain
<tt>YES</tt> (in uppercase), followed by a space and the number of
obtained words, otherwise it should contain <tt>NO</tt> (uppercase) only.
