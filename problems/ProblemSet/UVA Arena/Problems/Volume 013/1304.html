The art galleries of the new and very futuristic building of the
Center for Balkan Cooperation have the form of polygons (not
necessarily convex). When a big exhibition is organized, watching
over all of the pictures is a big security concern. Your task is
that for a given gallery to write a program which finds the
surface of the area of the floor, from which each point on the
walls of the gallery is visible. On the first figure a map of a
gallery is given in some co-ordinate system. The area wanted is
shaded on the second figure.

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

The number of tasks <span class="MATH"><i>T</i></span> that your program have to solve will be on
the first row of the input file. Input data for each task start
with an integer <span class="MATH"><i>N</i></span>, 
<span class="MATH">5<img width="18" height="30" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="2512img2.gif" alt="$ \le$"><i>N</i><img width="18" height="30" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="2512img2.gif" alt="$ \le$">1500</span>. Each of the next <span class="MATH"><i>N</i></span> rows of the input
will contain the co-ordinates of a vertex of the polygon  two
integers that fit in 16-bit integer type, separated by a single
space. Following the row with the co-ordinates of the last vertex
for the task comes the line with the number of vertices for the
next test and so on.

Output</a>&nbsp;</font>

For each test you must write on one line the required surface - a
number with exactly two digits after the decimal point (the number
should be rounded to the second digit after the decimal point).
