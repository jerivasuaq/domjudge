<p>A supermarket has a set <i>Prod</i> of products on sale. It earns a profit  p<sub>x</sub>  for
each product x in <i>Prod</i> sold by a deadline d<sub>x</sub> that is measured  as  an  integral
number of time units starting from the moment the sale begins. Each  product
takes precisely one unit of time for being sold. A selling  schedule  is  an
ordered subset of products <i>Sell</i> from <i>Prod</i> such that the selling of  each  product
x in <i>Sell</i>, according to the ordering of Sell, completes before the deadline  d<sub>x</sub>
or  just  when  d<sub>x</sub>  expires.  The  profit  of  the   selling   schedule   is
<img src="p2757a.gif">. An  optimal  selling  schedule  is  a  schedule  with  a
maximum profit.</p>

<p>For example, consider  the  products  Prod={a,b,c,d}  with  (p<sub>a</sub>,p<sub>a</sub>=(50,2),
(p<sub>b</sub>,p<sub>b</sub>=(10,1), (p<sub>c</sub>,p<sub>c</sub>=(20,2), and  (p<sub>d</sub>,p<sub>d</sub>=(30,1).  The  possible  selling
schedules are listed in table  1.  For  instance,  the  schedule  Sell={d,a}
shows that the selling of product d starts at time 0 and  ends  at  time  1,
while the selling of product a starts at time 1 and ends at time 2. Each  of
these products is sold by its deadline. Sell is  the  optimal  schedule  and
its profit is 80.</p>

<p>Write a program that reads sets of products from  an  input  text  file  and
computes the  profit  of  an  optimal  selling  schedule  for  each  set  of
products.</p>

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>A set of products starts with an integer 0 &lt;= n &lt;= 10000, which is the  number  of
products in the  set,  and  continues  with  n  pairs  pi  di  of  integers,
1 &lt;= pi &lt;= 10000 and  1 &lt;= di &lt;= 10000,  that  designate  the  profit  and  the  selling
deadline of the i-th product. White spaces can occur freely in input.  Input
data terminate with an end of file and are guaranteed correct.</p>

Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
<p>For each set of products, the program prints  on  the  standard  output  the
profit of an optimal selling schedule for the set. Each  result  is  printed
from the beginning of a separate line.</p>

The sample input contains two product sets. The first  set  encodes  the
products from table 1. The second set is for 7 products. The  profit  of  an
optimal schedule for these products is 185.
