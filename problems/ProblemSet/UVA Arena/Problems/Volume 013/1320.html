<p>
Outel, a famous semiconductor company, released recently a new model of microprocessor called Platinium. Like
many modern processors, Platinium can execute many instructions in one clock step providing that there are no
dependencies between them (instruction <span class="MATH"><i>I</i><sub>2</sub></span> is dependent on instruction <span class="MATH"><i>I</i><sub>1</sub></span> if for example <span class="MATH"><i>I</i><sub>2</sub></span> reads
a register that <span class="MATH"><i>I</i><sub>1</sub></span> writes to). Some processors are so clever that they calculate on they which instructions
can be safely executed in parallel. Platinium however expects this information to be explicitly specified.
A special marker, called simply a <span class="textit">stop</span>, inserted between two instructions indicatesthat some instructions
after the stop are possibly dependent on some instructions before the stop. In other words instructions between
two successive stops can be executed in parallel and there should not be dependencies between them.

<p>
Another interesting feature of Platinium is that a sequence of instructions must be split into groups of one,
two or three successive instructions. Each group has to be packed into a container called a
<span class="textit">bundle</span>. Each bundle has 3 slots and a single instruction can be put into each slot, however some
slots may stay empty. Each instruction is categorized into one of 10 instruction types denoted by consecutive
capital letters from <tt>A</tt> to <tt>J</tt> (instructions of the same type have similar functionality, for
example type <tt>A</tt> groups integer arithmetic instructions and type <tt>F</tt> groups floating-point
instructions). Only instructions of certain types are allowed to be packed into one bundle. A <span class="textit">template</span>
specifies one permissible combination of instruction types within a bundle. A template can also specify a
position of a stop in the middle of a bundle (there is at most one such stop allowed). In addition, stops
are allowed between any two adjoining bundles. A set of templates is called a <span class="textit">bundling profile</span>.
When packing instructions into bundles, one has to use templates from bundling profile only.

<p>
Although Platinium is equipped with an instruction cache it was found that for maximal performance it is
most crucial to pack instructions as densely as possible. Second important thing is to use a small number of stops.

<p>
Your task is to write a program for bundling Platinium instructions. For the sake of simplicity we assume
that the instructions cannot be reordered.

<span class="textbf">Task</span>

<p>
Write a program that:

<ul>
<li>reads a bundling prole and a sequence of instructions,
</li>
<li>computes the minimal number of bundles into which the sequence can be packed without breaking the
dependencies and the minimal number of all stops that are required for the minimal number of bundles,
</li>
<li>writes the result.
</li>
</ul>

Input consists of several test case, each separated by a blank line. The first line of the file indicates the number of test cases, and it's followed by a blank line.
<p>
The first line of each dataset contains two integers <span class="MATH"><i>t</i></span> and <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span> separated by a single space. Integer

which the stop is positioned (0 means no stop within the bundle).

Each of the next <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span> lines specifies one instruction. The <span class="MATH"><i>i</i></span>-th line of these <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span> lines contains one capital
