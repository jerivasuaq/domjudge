We are to predict some facts about the behavior of a single processor designed
for running two programs in parallel. Programs are sequences of commands according
to the following grammar:

<p>
A <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>Variable<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> is a sequence of (at most 20) alphanumeric characters
(A...Z, a...z, and 0...9) starting with a letter (not case sensitive).
A <span class="MATH">&lt;</span>constant<span class="MATH">&gt;</span> is an unsigned integer number (less than 100). There may be
arbitrary number of blank or tab characters between tokens.

<p>
Before execution, programs are translated into machine language. A statement
of the form X := Y + Z is translated to the following set of machine instructions:

<p>
<pre>
Mov R1, Y
Mov R2, Z
Add R1, R2
Mov X, R1
</pre>

<p>
A MOV instruction copies the content of its second operand into
its first operand. An `<tt>Add (Sub)</tt>' instruction, adds
(subtracts) its second operand from its first operand and the
result is stored in the first operand. Note that Y and Z denote
either a variable or an integer constant. Instructions generated
for the command X := Y - Z is similar to the above instructions,
except that `<tt>Sub</tt>' command is used instead of `<tt>Add</tt>'.

<p>
The processor is given two machine language programs and starts executing them
from the first instruction. In each step, it randomly selects one of the two
programs and runs the next instruction from the selected program. This continues
until one program reaches its end. In this situation, the remaining instructions
from the other one are executed sequentially to the end and the processor stops.
It is assumed that all variables are shared between two programs, but each program
has a separate register set. The goal of this program is to compute the expected
final value of all variables among all possible executions of the programs.
More precisely, we want to consider every possible execution of the two programs
and for each variable, calculate the average of its final value in different executions.
It is assumed that the initial value of all variables is zero.

<p>
The first line of the input file contains a single integer <span class="MATH"><i>t</i></span> (
<span class="MATH">1<img width="18" height="30" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="2344img2.gif" alt="$ \le$"><i>t</i><img width="18" height="30" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="2344img2.gif" alt="$ \le$">10</span>), the number of test cases, followed by the input
data for each test case. The data for each test case consists of a
pair of programs. Each program is written as a sequence of
consecutive lines, each line containing exactly one command.
Programs end with a line containing only the word `<tt>END</tt>'. You
may assume that no variable in any program is named `END'. There
is no blank line between programs of one test case. There are at
least one and at most 25 lines in each program. Total number of
variables in two programs is no more than 10.

Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>
For each test case, the output file should contain the expected
final value of all variables in alphabetical order of variable
names (digits precede letters in this order). Output for different
test cases should be separated by exactly one blank line. Round
the numbers in the output to 4 digits after decimal point. Do not
omit trailing zeros after decimal point (e.g. write 1.2000 instead
of 1.2).
