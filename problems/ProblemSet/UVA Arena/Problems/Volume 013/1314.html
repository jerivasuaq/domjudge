<p>Some time the programmers have very strange ways to  hide  their  passwords.
See for example how Billy "Hacker" Geits hide his password. Billy chooses  a
string S composed of small Latin letters with length L. Then he makes all L-
1 one-letter left cyclic shifts of the string and takes as  a  password  one
prefix of the lexicographically first of  the  obtained  strings  (including
S). For example let consider the string alabala. The cyclic one-letter  left
shifts (including the initial string) are:</p>

<pre>
            alabala
            labalaa
            abalaal
            balaala
            alaalab
            laalaba
            aalabal
</pre>

<p>and lexicographically first of them is the string aalabal. The first  letter
of this string is in position 6 in the initial string (the positions in  the
string are counted from 0).</p>

<p>Write a program that for given string S finds  the  start  position  of  the
smallest lexicographically one-letter left cyclic shift of this  string.  If
the smallest lexicographically left shift appears more than  once  then  the
program have to output the smallest initial position.</p>

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>

<p>Your program has to be ready to solve more than one  test  case.  The  first
line of the input file will contains only the number T of  the  test  cases.
Each of the following T lines will  describe  one  test  case  -  first  the
length L of the string (5 &lt;= L &lt;= 100000) and then, separated by  one  space,  the
string S itself.</p>

<p>The output file have to contain exactly T lines with a single number each  -
the initial position found by your program.</p>
