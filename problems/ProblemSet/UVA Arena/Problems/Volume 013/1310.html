In a certain town there are <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span> intersections connected by two- and one-way streets. The town is very
modern so a lot of streets run through tunnels or viaducts. Of course it is possible to travel between any
two intersections in both ways, i.e. it is possible to travel from an intersection <span class="MATH"><i>a</i></span> to an intersection <span class="MATH"><i>b</i></span> as
well as from <span class="MATH"><i>b</i></span> to <span class="MATH"><i>a</i></span> without violating traffic rules. Because one-way streets are safer, it has been decided
to create as much one-way traffic as possible. In order not to make too much confusion it has also been
decided that the direction of traffic in already existing one-way streets should not be changed.

<p>
Your job is to create a new traffic system in the town. You have to determine the direction of traffic
for as many two-way streets as possible and make sure that it is still possible to travel both ways between
any two intersections.

<p>

<p>
<br>
Write a program that:

<ul>
<li>reads a description of the street system in the town from the standard input,
</li>
<li>for each two-way street determines one direction of traffic or decides that the street must remain
two-way,
</li>
<li>writes the answer to the standard output.
</li>
</ul>

The first line of the input contains two integers <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span> and <span class="MATH"><i>m</i></span>, where 
<span class="MATH">2<img width="18" height="30" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="2664img1.png" alt="$ \le$"><i>n</i><img width="18" height="30" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="2664img1.png" alt="$ \le$">2000</span> and 
<span class="MATH"><i>n</i> - 1<img width="18" height="30" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="2664img1.png" alt="$ \le$"><i>m</i><img width="18" height="30" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="2664img1.png" alt="$ \le$"><i>n</i>(<i>n</i> - 1)/2</span>.
Integer <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span> is the number of intersections in the town and integer <span class="MATH"><i>m</i></span> is the number of streets.

<p>
Each of the next <span class="MATH"><i>m</i></span> lines contains three integers <span class="MATH"><i>a</i></span>, <span class="MATH"><i>b</i></span> and <span class="MATH"><i>c</i></span>, where 
<span class="MATH">1<img width="18" height="30" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="2664img1.png" alt="$ \le$"><i>a</i><img width="18" height="30" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="2664img1.png" alt="$ \le$"><i>n</i></span>, 
<span class="MATH">1<img width="18" height="30" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="2664img1.png" alt="$ \le$"><i>b</i><img width="18" height="30" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="2664img1.png" alt="$ \le$"><i>n</i></span>, <span class="MATH"><i>a</i><img width="18" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="2664img2.png" alt="$ \ne$"><i>b</i></span> and
<span class="MATH"><i>c</i></span> belongs to {1, 2}. If <span class="MATH"><i>c</i> = 1</span> then intersections <span class="MATH"><i>a</i></span> and <span class="MATH"><i>b</i></span> are connected by an one-way street from <span class="MATH"><i>a</i></span> to
<span class="MATH"><i>b</i></span>. If <span class="MATH"><i>c</i> = 2</span> then intersections <span class="MATH"><i>a</i></span> and <span class="MATH"><i>b</i></span> are connected by a two-way street. There is at most one street
connecting any two intersections.

Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
The output contains exactly the same number of lines as the number of two-way streets in the input.
For each such street (in any order) the program should write three integers <span class="MATH"><i>a</i></span>, <span class="MATH"><i>b</i></span> and <span class="MATH"><i>c</i></span> meaning, the new
direction of the street from <span class="MATH"><i>a</i></span> to <span class="MATH"><i>b</i></span> (<span class="MATH"><i>c</i> = 1</span>) or that the street connecting <span class="MATH"><i>a</i></span> and <span class="MATH"><i>b</i></span> remains two-way (<span class="MATH"><i>c</i> = 2</span>).
If there are more than one solution with maximal number of one-way streets then your program should
output any of them but just one.
