The famous Ghost Busters team has decided to upgrade their Ectomobile
(aka Ecto-1) with a powerful proton gun and an advanced targeting system.
Egon has designed and built all the hardware which consists of ectoplasmic
scanner and a proton gun that has two degrees of freedom and can automatically
rotate and fire in a 90 degrees trihedral angle. You have been hired to
write a prototype for the targeting software.

<p>

<p>
<br>
Ghosts are detected by ectoplasmic scanner and are represented as
floating spheres. The coordinates of their centers and radii are
delivered from the ectoplasmic scanner to the targeting software. The
coordinate system is aligned is such a way, that the proton gun fires
from the point (0, 0, 0) anywhere into
<span class="MATH"><i>X</i><img width="18" height="30" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="2693img2.gif" alt="$ \ge$"> 0</span>, <span class="MATH"><i>Y</i><img width="18" height="30" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="2693img2.gif" alt="$ \ge$"> 0</span>, <span class="MATH"><i>Z</i><img width="18" height="30" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="2693img2.gif" alt="$ \ge$"> 0</span>
trihedral angle. The gun fires a proton ray in a straight line
and is so powerful, that even a touch of its ray is enough to kill
a ghost. The ray of the proton gun is able to kill a virtually unlimited
number of ghosts on its way.

<p>

<p>
<br>
For the first prototype for the targeting software, you are asked to
write a program that determines the maximal number of ghosts that can
be killed with a single shot of the proton gun.

On the first line of the input file there is a single integer number

scanner of Ecto-1. The following <span class="MATH"><i>N</i></span> lines describe detected ghosts - one
ghost per line. The description of <span class="MATH"><i>i</i></span>-th ghost (ghosts are
numbered from 1 to <span class="MATH"><i>N</i></span>) consists of 4 integer numbers <span class="MATH"><i>X</i><sub>i</sub></span>,
<span class="MATH"><i>Y</i><sub>i</sub></span>, <span class="MATH"><i>Z</i><sub>i</sub></span>, and <span class="MATH"><i>R</i><sub>i</sub></span>, separated by spaces.

are the coordinates of the ghost's center, and <span class="MATH"><i>R</i><sub>i</sub></span>
(
<span class="MATH">1<img width="18" height="30" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="2693img3.gif" alt="$ \le$"><i>R</i><sub>i</sub><img width="18" height="30" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="2693img3.gif" alt="$ \le$">min(<i>X</i><sub>i</sub>, <i>Y</i><sub>i</sub>, <i>Z</i><sub>i</sub>)</span>) is the ghost's radius.
Because ghosts are ectoplasmic, they can be arbitrarily placed in respect
to each others. They can intersect, fit inside each other, coincide with each
other, etc.

On the first line of the output file write a single integer number -
the maximal number of ghosts that can be killed with a single shot
of the proton gun. On the second line of the output file write the
identifying numbers of the ghosts to be killed in an arbitrary order
separated by spaces. If there are multiple ways to kill this
number of ghosts then write any one.
