<p>
Hi-Q is a popular solitaire game that comes in a small box with a
playing board that has little holes in the shape of a cross and 32
little pegs that fit into the holes.  Starting with the centermost hole
open, players move the pegs by jumping one peg over another,
either in a horizontal or vertical direction and removing each peg
that is jumped over.  Diagonal jumps are not allowed.  The object
for players is to remove as many pegs from the board as possible. 
This problem involves writing a program that will automatically
play Hi-Q so that we can investigate how the game might unfold
based on various opening arrangements of pegs.
<p>
<p>
There is a peg board with the following
shape and with holes numbered from 1 to 33 as follows:
<p>
<pre>                              1         2         3
                              4         5         6
          7         8         9        10        11        12        13
         14        15        16        17        18        19        20
         21        22        23        24        25        26        27        
                             28        29        30
                             31        32        33</pre>
<p>
An instance of the game begins with some holes having pegs in
them and the rest of the holes being empty.   The game proceeds by
jumping one peg over another, either horizontally or vertically,
with the peg that is jumping landing in an empty hole, and the peg
being jumped over being removed from the board.  For example, if
9 is empty and 10 and 11 are not, then the peg in 11 can be
``moved&quot; to 9 with the peg in 10 being removed. After this move,
10 and 11 would both be empty but 9 would have a peg in it.
<p>
Given a specific board configuration your program will pick and
model a specific move, over and over, until no more moves are
available. Your program will then report the sum of the holes that
still have pegs in them.  At any point during the game there may be
more than one possible move available.  In such a case always
model the move with the target hole of the moving peg as large as
possible.  If there is more than one move available to the largest
possible target hole, then choose from those moves the one with
the larger source hole.
<p>
<p>
For example, if the board looks like this, with <tt>X</tt> representing a peg
and <tt>O</tt> representing a hole:
<p>
<pre>                              O         O         O
                              O         O         O
          O         O         O         X         O         X         O
          O         O         O         X         O         X         O
          O         O         O         O         X         O         O
                              O         O         O
                              O         O         O</pre>
<p>
then the following jumps would be made: 1: from 12 over 19 to 26
(26, 24, and 5 are the only possible targets and 26 is the largest), 2:
from 26 to 24 over 25 (5 and 24 are the only possible targets with
24 &gt; 5 plus 24 is the target for two possible moves, one from 26
and one from 10; the one from 26 is used since 26 &gt; 10), 3: from
17 to 29 (29 &gt; 5), and two pegs would be left, one in hole 10 and
one in hole 29.  Thus 39 would be reported as the result for this
instance.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> The above paragraph is wrong.  This was discovered shortly
 after the contest began, and the correction was broadcast to all
 teams. The second jump should be from 25 to 27. The third jump
 should be from 10 to 24. The two pegs left will be in holes 24
 and 27 and 51 should be reported as the result.

<p>
The first line contains an integer <i>N</i> between 1 and 10
describing how many instances of the game are represented.  The
remaining lines will describe <i>N</i> instances of the game by listing the
holes which begin with pegs in them, in increasing order.  A 0 will
indicate the end of each  sequence of unique numbers between 1
and 33 that represents an instance of the game.
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</a></font></h2>
<p>
There should be <i>N</i>+2 lines of output.  The first line of
output will read <tt>HI Q OUTPUT</tt>. There will then be one line of
output for each instance of the game, reporting the sum of the holes
that still have pegs in them for the final configuration of that
instance.. The final line of output should read <tt>END OF OUTPUT</tt>.
