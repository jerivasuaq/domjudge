The Slow Boat to China Shipping company needs a program to
help them quickly quote costs to prospective customers. The cost
of a shipment depends on the size of the shipment and on how
many shipping legs it requires.  A shipping leg connects two
warehouses, but since every pair of warehouses is not directly
connected by a leg, it might require more than one leg to send a
shipment from one warehouse to another.
<p>
<p>
A data set can represent from 1 to 30
warehouses. A two-letter code name will identify each warehouse
(capital letters only).  Shipping legs can exist between any two
distinct warehouses. All legs are bidirectional.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>The cost of a shipment is equal to the size of the shipment times
the number of shipping legs required times $100.</b>
<p>
<p>
The input to the program identifies the warehouse code names and
the existence of all shipping legs.  For a given shipping request,
consisting of the size of the shipment, the source warehouse and
the destination warehouse, the program will output the best
(cheapest) cost for the shipment, if it is possible to send shipments
from the requested source to the requested destination. Alternately,
the program must state that the request cannot be fulfilled.
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</a></font></h2>
<p>
The first line will contain an integer from 1 to 10 inclusive
that represents the number of  data sets in the input file.  Each data
set represents a new shipping configuration.
<p>
<p>
The first line of data in a data set will contain three integers, say
<i>M</i>, <i>N</i>, and <i>P</i>:  <i>M</i> is an integer from 1 to 30 inclusive representing
the number of warehouses in the data set;  <i>N</i> is an integer from 0 to
<i>M</i>*(<i>M</i>-1)/2 inclusive that represents the number of legs between
warehouses in the data set; <i>P</i> is an integer from 0 to 10 inclusive
that represents the number of shipping requests for which cost
information is required.
<p>
The second line of data in a data set contains <i>M</i> two-letter code
names for the <i>M</i> warehouses of the data sets.  Only capital letters
are used. A single blank separates code names.
<p>
<i>N</i> lines follow the line of code names, containing shipping leg
information in the format: ``<em>XX YY</em>&quot;, with <em>XX</em> and <em>YY</em> being 
the codes for two distinct warehouses in the set that have a 
direct link (a shipping leg) between them. There will be a single 
blank between the warehouse codes.
<p>
The <i>N</i> lines of shipping leg information are followed by <i>P</i> lines of
shipping requests, one request per line.  Each shipping request will
begin with an integer between 1 and 20 inclusive that represents
the size of the shipment.  The shipment size will be followed by a
pair of code names in the format ``<em>AA  BB</em>&quot;, with <em>AA</em> and <em>BB</em>
being the code for two distinct warehouses in the set which
represent the source and destination of the requested shipment.
<p>
<p>
The input will be valid and consistent.  A shipping leg will only be
represented once within a data set.  Data about legs will always
refer to warehouses that have been identified as belonging to the
data set.  See the example below for clarification of the input
format.
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</a></font></h2>
<p>
The first line of output should read ``<tt>SHIPPING ROUTES OUTPUT</tt>&quot;. For each data set there should be a section of output
enumerating which data set the output section represents followed
by <i>P</i> lines of the required information. Each of the <i>P</i> lines should
list either the cheapest cost of the respective shipment or the phrase
``<tt>NO SHIPMENT POSSIBLE</tt>&quot;. The end of the output should be
noted also.  Produce output consistent with the example below.
