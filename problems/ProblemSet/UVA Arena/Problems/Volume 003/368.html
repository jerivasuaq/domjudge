<p>
Write a program to create an index
of a small collection of World Wide Web pages.
Each ``page&quot; is a text file in a special format called HTML (HyperText
Markup Language).  The HTML format includes
regular text and special HTML commands, which are always enclosed in
anglebraces. For example, the string
<tt>&lt;A HREF=&quot;layout.htm&quot;&gt;</tt> is an HTML command
meaning that the following text should be highlighted; a user click on
the highlighted text would cause a web browser to fetch and display the
file <tt>layout.htm</tt>.
<p>
<p>
Your program's job is to read an HTML file called
<tt>index.htm</tt> and all the files referenced within
<tt>index.htm</tt> by the HREF command and all the files
referenced by those files, and so on until there are
no new files to read.  Your program
should also read the file <tt>webpage.in</tt> containing
a list of words and show a list of all the
files referenced from <tt>index.htm</tt> which
contain each word (see the Sample Output).
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Assumptions</a></font></h2>
<p>
<ol><li> Any opening angle bracket (the ``&lt;&quot; character)
will be followed sooner or later by a matching
closing angle bracket (the ``&gt;&quot; character).<li> A word is any string of characters found in a file that:
<dl compact=""><dt><strong>-</strong>
<dd> does not lie between matching angle brackets
<dt><strong>-</strong>
<dd> contains only letters (no spaces, hyphens, apostrophes, etc.)
<dt><strong>-</strong>
<dd> is not part of a longer word (e.g., in ``balloon&quot;, we would
not consider ``loon&quot; to be a word).
<p>
 </dd></dt></dd></dt></dd></dt></dl><li> Words will have at most 25 characters.<li> Words which differ only in case should be considered
to be the same.  Thus, ``Word&quot;, ``word&quot;, ``WORD&quot;, and ``wOrD&quot;
would be considered to be the same word.<li> The only HTML command you need to worry about is the HREF command,
and you can assume that it will always be
in the form <tt>&lt;A HREF=&quot;filename&quot;&gt;</tt>, with no additional spaces
or other characters; that the name of the file is legal and in the same
directory as the file you are already reading; and that the name of the
file will not exceed twelve characters
in length.  Filenames will always end with ``<tt>.htm</tt>&quot;.<li> HTML files may be mutually referential or self referential,
but there will be at most one hundred different files to read.
</li></li></li></li></li></li></ol><h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Input</a></font></h2>
<p>
The initial HTML file you should start indexing
will be named <tt>index.htm</tt>.  Next the other files, including <tt>webpage.in</tt>, with a single blank line separating each listing. The words in <tt>webpage.in</tt> will be placed one word per line, with no additional spaces.
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001003000000000000000">Output</a></font></h2>
<p>
List each word in the standard input file, followed by a list of the file names
it is found in, in the following format:
<p>
<pre>&quot;word&quot; can be found in the following pages:
     filename1
     filename2

&quot;word&quot; can be found in the following pages:
     filename3

&quot;word&quot; can not be found in any page.</pre>
<p>
Where <tt>word</tt> is the word from the input
file, and <tt>filename1</tt>, <tt>filename2</tt>, and so on, are
the names of the files containing the word.  Each file name should be
indented five spaces: a single blank line should separate each listing.
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001004000000000000000">Sample Input (there are three files: <tt>index.htm</tt>, <tt>layout.htm</tt>,
and <tt>webpage.in</tt>)</a></font></h2>

&lt;H1&gt;Following Links&lt;/H1&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Don't forget that links can be &lt;A HREF=&quot;index.htm&quot;&gt;
self-referential&lt;/A&gt;!&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;/BODY&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;

&lt;A bunch of gibberish and a word&gt;
Note that there is no rule that the file needs to be legal HTML
(if you know the rules), or that words really be wordseiwlaoieu;a. 
&lt;A HREF=&quot;index.htm&quot;&gt;Watch out for mutual references!
