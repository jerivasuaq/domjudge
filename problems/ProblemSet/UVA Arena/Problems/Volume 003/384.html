Recognizing strings based on a set of restrictions is a common
computational problem.

<p>
A Slurpy is a string of characters that has certain
properties.  Your program will read in strings of characters and output
whether or not they are Slurpys.
<p>
<p>
A <b>Slump</b> is a character string that has the following properties:
<p>
<ol><li> Its first character is either a 'D' or an 'E'.<li> The first character is followed by a string of one or more 'F's.<li> The string of one or more 'F's is followed by either a Slump or a 'G'.
     The Slump or 'G' that follows the F's ends the Slump.  For example 
     DFFEFFFG is a Slump since it has a 'D' for its first character,
     followed by a string of two F's, and ended by the Slump 'EFFFG'.<li> Nothing else is a Slump.
</li></li></li></li></ol>
<p>
A <b>Slimp</b> is a character string that has the following properties:
<p>
<ol><li> Its first character is an 'A'.<li> If it is a two character Slimp then its second 
     and last character is an 'H'.<li> If it is not a two character Slimp then it is in 
     one of these two forms:
<dl compact=""><dt><strong>a)</strong>
<dd> 'A' followed by 'B' followed by a Slimp 
          followed by a 'C'.
<dt><strong>b)</strong>
<dd> 'A' followed by a Slump (see above) 
          followed by a 'C'.
<p>
 </dd></dt></dd></dt></dl><li> Nothing else is a Slimp.
</li></li></li></li></ol>
<p>
A <b>Slurpy</b> is a character string that consists of a Slimp followed by a
Slump.

<p>
The first line contains an integer <i>N</i> between 1 and 10 describing
how many strings of characters are represented.  The next <i>N</i> lines each
contain a string of 1 to 60 alpha characters.
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001004000000000000000">Output</a></font></h2>
<p>
The first line of output should read <tt>SLURPYS OUTPUT</tt>.  Each
of the next N lines of output should consist of either <tt>YES</tt> or <tt>NO</tt>
depending on whether or not the corresponding input line is a Slurpy.  The
last line of output should read <tt>END OF OUTPUT</tt>.
