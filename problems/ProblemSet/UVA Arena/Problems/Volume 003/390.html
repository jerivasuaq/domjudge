<p>
Cryptographic analysis makes extensive use of the frequency with
which letters and letter sequences
occur in a language. If an encrypted text is known to be in english,
for example, a great deal can
be learned from the fact that the letters E, L, N, R, S, and T are
the most common ones used in
written english. Even more can be learned if common letter pairs,
triplets, etc. are known.
<p>
For this problem you are to write a program which accepts as input
a text file of unspecified length
and performs letter sequence analysis on the text. The program will
report the five most frequent
letter sequences for each set of sequences from one to five letters.
That is it will report the individual
characters which occur with the five highest frequencies, the pairs of
characters which occur with
the five highest frequencies, and so on up to the letter sequences
of five characters which occur with the five highest frequencies.
<p>
The program should consider contiguous sequences of alphabetic
characters only, and case should
be ignored (e.g. an `a' is the same as an `A'). A report should be
produced using the format shown
in the example at the end of this problem description.
For each sequence length from one to five,
the report should list the sequences in descending order of frequency.
If there are several sequences
with the same frequency then all sequences should be listed in
alphabetical order as shown (list
all sequences in upper case). Finally, if there are less than
five distinct frequencies for a particular
sequence length, simply report as many distinct frequency lists as possible.
