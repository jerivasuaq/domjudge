David hates to wait at stop signs, yield signs and traffic signals while
driving.  To minimize this  aggravation, he has prepared maps of the
various regions in which he frequently drives, and  measured the average
delay (in seconds) at each of the various intersections in these
regions.  He  wants to find the routes between specified points in these
regions which minimize his delay at  intersections (regardless of the
total distance he has to drive to avoid delays), and has enlisted  your
assistance in this effort.
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</a></font></h2>
<p>
For each region, David provides you with a map.  The map
data first identifies some number of  intersections, <i>NI</i>.  The regions
never include more than 10 intersections.  The intersections in each 
region are numbered sequentially, starting with the number one (1).  For
each intersection, in turn,  the input then specifies the number of
streets leading away from the intersection, and for each  such street,
the number of the intersection to which the street leads, and the
average delay, in  seconds, that David encounters at that intersection. 
Following the data for the last intersection in  a region there appear
the numbers associated with the intersections where David wants to start
 and end his drive.  The entire input consists of a sequence of maps,
followed by the single integer  zero (0).

<p>
For each region, in order, print a single line of
output which contains the region number (they,  too, are sequentially
numbered, starting with 1), a list of the intersection numbers David
will  encounter in the route with minimum average delay, and the average
number of seconds he will be  delayed while travelling this route.  A
suitable format is shown in the example below.

<p>
<ol><li> There will always be a unique route with the minimum average delay
in each region.<li> A street from intersection <i>I</i> to intersection <i>J</i> is one-way.  To
represent a two-way street from <i>I</i>  to <i>J</i>, the map must also include a
route from intersection <i>J</i> to intersection <i>I</i>.<li> There will never be more than one route directly from intersection
<i>I</i> to intersection <i>J</i>.

Suppose David wants to travel from intersection 2 to
intersection 4 in the region shown in the  following map:

<pre>                +---------------+                   From To Delay
