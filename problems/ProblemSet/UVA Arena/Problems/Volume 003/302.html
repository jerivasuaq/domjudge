Little Johnny has got a new car. He decided to drive around the town to
visit his friends. Johnny
wanted to visit all his friends, but there was many of them. In each street
he had one friend. He started
thinking how to make his trip as short as possible. Very soon he realized
that the best way to do it was to
travel through each street of town only once. Naturally, he wanted to
finish his trip at the same place he
started, at his parents' house.
<p>
The streets in Johnny's town were named by integer numbers from 1 to <i>n</i>,
<i>n</i> &lt; 1995. The junctions
were independently named by integer numbers from 1 to <i>m</i>,  <img width="54" height="25" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline32" src="302img1.gif"> .
All junctions in the town had different numbers. Each street was
connecting exactly two (not necessarily different) junctions.
No two streets in the town had the same number. He immediately started to
plan his round trip. If there
was more than one such round trip, he would have chosen the one which,
when written down as a sequence
of street numbers is lexicographically the smallest.
<p>
But Johnny was not
able to find even one such round trip.
Help Johnny and write a program which finds the desired shortest round
trip. If the round trip does
not exist the program should write a message. Assume that Johnny lives at
the junction ending the 1st street input
with smaller number. All streets in the town are two way. There
exists a way from each street to
another street in the town. The streets in the town are very narrow and
there is no possibility to turn back the car once he is in the street.

<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</a></font></h2>
<p>
Input file consists of several blocks. Each block describes one town.
Each line in the block contains
three integers <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, where <i>x</i> &gt; 0 and <i>y</i> &gt; 0 are the numbers of
junctions which are connected by the street
number <i>z</i>. The end of the block is marked by the line containing <i>x</i> = <i>y</i> = 0.
At the end of the input file there is an empty block, <i>x</i> = <i>y</i> = 0.
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</a></font></h2>
<p>
The output file consists of 2 line blocks corresponding to the blocks of
the input file. The first line of
each block contains the sequence of street numbers (single members of the
sequence are separated by space)
describing Johnny's round trip. If the round trip cannot be found the
corresponding output block contains
the message ``<tt>Round trip does not exist.</tt>''. The second line of each
block is empty.
