Everyone is familiar with the pictorial representation of family trees.
In these &quot;pictures&quot; one uses points and lines to represent family
structures and interfamily relationships. Thus, if M and F are the
parents of three children, two boys and one girl, we have the figure
below:

<p>
The next figure might represent the inter-family relationship of two
families

<p>
It is easy to conceive of a large number of such pictures. Some can represent
family trees and some cannot. You are to consider the
problem of characterizing those which can represent family trees. We will
actually work in a simpler context than that of human
relationships. Most human societies preclude family trees of the forms
shown below.

It is, however, quite complicated to give conditions which would eliminate
pictures of this sort. For simplicity, we suppose that we are
dealing with a population which is completely characterized by the condition
of bisexual reproduction (M &amp; F). If the picture or graph
is such that by a proper assignment of sexes to the members of the
population, the picture represents the results of a breeding
experiment which could theoretically take place, then we say the graph is
sexy. Otherwise the graph is not sexy. You must write a
program to examine an arbitrary directed graph and determine if it is sexy.

<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</a></font></h2>
<p>
Input will be a series of descriptions of graphs in the following form:
<p>
<p>
An integer <i>n</i> indicating the number of nodes in the graph, followed by
an integer <i>m</i> indicating the number of directed edges in the graph
will appear on the first line of input. The next <i>m</i> lines of the file
will each contain a pair <i>x</i>, <i>y</i> of integers in the range 1 - <i>n</i>. Each pair will represent a directed edge from node <i>x</i> to node <i>y</i>. Input is terminated by end-of-file.
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</a></font></h2>
<p>
For each graph in the input file, you will output the appropriate one of
the following statements.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<tt>Graph number </tt> <i>i</i> <tt>is sexy</tt>
<p>
<tt>Graph number </tt> <i>i</i> <tt>is not sexy</tt>
<p>
<p>
The number <i>i</i> represents the number of the graph in the input file.
<p>
<p>
We are adopting the convention that the existence of a directed edge
from <i>x</i> to <i>y</i> indicates that <i>x</i> is a parent of <i>y</i>. Further, each individual
usually has exactly two parents. No individual can have two parents of
the same sex or more than two parents. Breeding experiments do
not extend into the indefinite past. A point is always reached where
one or both of the parents of a member of the population are
unknown. The nodes with no parents would appear on the top level of
a sexy graph. Births of individuals are assumed to be sequential in
time. Thus the following graph is not sexy.
