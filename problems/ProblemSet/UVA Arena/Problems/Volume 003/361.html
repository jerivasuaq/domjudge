You are to simulate a game of Cops and Robbers.  In this game,
cops, robbers, and other citizens are
represented as points in a two-dimensional plane. A citizen is said to be
<em>safe</em> if it is within a triangle formed by three cops.  A citizen
is said to be <em>robbed</em> if it is not safe and is within a triangle
formed by three robbers.  A citizen is <em>neither safe nor robbed</em> if
it satisfies neither of the above conditions.
For purposes of this problem, a triangle consists of three
points, and a point is within a triangle if
it is inside or on the boundary of the triangle.
<p>
<p>
In the following diagram, filled circles represent cops, filled
squares represent robbers, and filled triangles represent citizens.
Dashed lines indicate triangles formed by cops or robbers

<p>
In this example, citizens A and B are safe, citizen C is robbed,
and citizen D is neither.
<p>
<p>
Given a set of cops and robbers and several citizen queries,
<b>efficiently</b> determine whether each citizen is safe, robbed, or neither.
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</a></font></h2>
<p>
The input consists of several data sets.  The first line of each data
set contains three non-negative integers
<i>c</i>, <i>r</i>, and <i>o</i>:  the number of cops,
robbers, and other citizens, respectively.
<i>c</i>, <i>r</i>, and <i>o</i> will each be at most 200.  The next <i>c</i>
lines contain the (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>) coordinates of each cop, one per line.
The next <i>r</i> lines contain the (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>) coordinates
of each robber, one per line.  The next <i>o</i> lines contain
the (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>) coordinates of each other citizen, one per line.
All coordinates are integers between -500 and 500
inclusive. 
<p>
<p>
Your program must stop processing
input when it encounters a data set in
which <i>c</i>, <i>r</i>, and <i>o</i> are all zero.
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</a></font></h2>
<p>
Output for each data set begins with a line identifying the data
set.  For each other citizen in the data set, output the line
<p>
<p>
<p>
<tt>Citizen at (</tt><i>x</i>,<i>y</i><tt>) is </tt><i>status</i><tt>.</tt>
<p>
<p>
<p>
where (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) is the location of the citizen from the input and <em>status</em>
is one of <tt>safe</tt>, <tt>robbed</tt> or <tt>neither</tt>.
Follow the format given in the Sample Output.  Leave a blank line after
the output from each data set.
