The Robot Moving Institute is using a robot in their local store to transport
different items.
Of course the robot should spend only the minimum time necessary when
travelling from one place
in the store to another. The robot can move only along a straight line (track).
All tracks form a
rectangular grid. Neighbouring tracks are one meter apart. The store is a
rectangle  <img width="54" height="24" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline41" src="314img1.gif">  meters
and it is entirely covered by this grid. The distance of the track closest
to the side of the store is
exactly one meter. The robot has a circular shape with diameter equal
to 1.6 meter. The track
goes through the center of the robot. The robot always faces north, south,
west or east. The tracks
are in the south-north and in the west-east directions. The robot can
move only in the direction
it faces. The direction in which it faces can be changed at each track
crossing. Initially the robot
stands at a track crossing. The obstacles in the store are formed from
pieces occupying  <img width="68" height="24" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline43" src="314img2.gif"> 
on the ground. Each obstacle is within a  <img width="37" height="24" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline45" src="314img3.gif">  square formed by the
tracks. The movement of the
robot is controlled by two commands. These commands are <tt>GO</tt> and <tt>TURN</tt>.
<p>
<p>
The <tt>GO</tt> command has one integer parameter  <img width="25" height="21" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline47" src="314img4.gif">  <tt>{1,2,3}</tt>. After
receiving this command the robot moves <i>n</i> meters in the direction it faces.
<p>
<p>
The <tt>TURN</tt> command has one parameter which is either <tt>left</tt>
or <tt>right</tt>. After receiving this
command the robot changes its orientation by 90<sup>o</sup> in the direction indicated
by the parameter.
<p>
<p>
The execution of each command lasts one second.
<p>
Help researchers of RMI to write a program which will determine the minimal
time in which
the robot can move from a given starting point to a given destination.

<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</a></font></h2>
<p>
The input file consists of blocks of lines. The first line of each block
contains two integers
 <img width="58" height="26" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline53" src="314img6.gif">  and  <img width="55" height="26" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline55" src="314img7.gif">  separated by one space. In each of the next <i>M</i>
lines there are <i>N</i> numbers
one or zero separated by one space. One represents obstacles and zero
represents empty squares.
(The tracks are between the squares.) The block is terminated by a line
containing four positive
integers  <img width="80" height="25" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline61" src="314img8.gif">  each followed by one space and the word indicating
the orientation of the
robot at the starting point.  <img width="18" height="25" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline63" src="314img9.gif"> ,  <img width="18" height="25" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline65" src="314img10.gif">  are the coordinates of the square
in the north-west corner of
which the robot is placed (starting point).  <img width="18" height="25" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline67" src="314img11.gif"> ,  <img width="18" height="25" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline69" src="314img12.gif">  are the coordinates
of square to the north-west
corner of which the robot should move (destination point). The orientation
of the robot when it
has reached the destination point is not prescribed. We use
(row, column)-type coordinates, i.e.
the coordinates of the upper left (the most north-west) square in the
store are 0,0 and the lower
right (the most south-east) square are <i>M</i> - 1, <i>N</i> - 1. The orientation is
given by the words <tt>north</tt>
or <tt>west</tt> or <tt>south</tt> or <tt>east</tt>. The last block contains only
one line with <i>N</i> = 0 and <i>M</i> = 0.
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</a></font></h2>
<p>
The output file contains one line for each block except the last block in
the input file. The
lines are in the order corresponding to the blocks in the input file. The
line contains minimal
number of seconds in which the robot can reach the destination point from
the starting point. If
there does not exist any path from the starting point to the destination
point the line will contain -1.
