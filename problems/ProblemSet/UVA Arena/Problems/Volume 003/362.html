A feature of many file transfer programs
is the ability to estimate the amount of time remaining in
the transfer.  These programs estimate the time remaining based on the number
of bytes left to be transferred and the rate of transfer in previous seconds.
You are to write a program to simulate this behavior.
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</a></font></h2>
<p>
The input will be a series of data sets, each set describing one file transfer.
The first line of each data set will be a single non-negative integer, telling
the size of the file in bytes.  The subsequent lines will be the number
of bytes transmitted in each second (all non-negative integers).  The sum
of the bytes transmitted will equal the number of bytes in the file.
<p>
<p>
The end of input will be indicated by a file size of 0 bytes.
This data set should not be processed.
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</a></font></h2>
<p>
The output for each data set should begin with a line with the number of
the data set and the size of the file being transferred.
Then, there should be update lines estimating how many seconds
remain, issued once every 5 seconds during the transfer.
<p>
<p>
To estimate the number of seconds remaining,
first determine the transfer rate (bytes/second) for the
previous 5 seconds.  If no bytes were transferred during this time, then
the transfer is <em>stalled</em>, and your
program should report this.  Otherwise, divide the number of bytes remaining
to be transferred by the transfer rate for the previous 5 seconds to estimate
the number of seconds remaining.
<p>
<p>
Report the number of seconds remaining as an integer.
Always round up in reporting how much time
is remaining (so if there are 12.2 seconds remaining, you should report
there are 13 seconds remaining).
<p>
<p>
At the end of the transfer, print a line telling how many seconds the transfer
took.  Use the format in the Sample Output.
<p>
<p>
There should be one blank line after the output from each data set.
