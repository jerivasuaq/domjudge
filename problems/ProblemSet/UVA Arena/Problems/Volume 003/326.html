<p>
     A very old technique for extrapolating a sequence of values  is  based
on  the  use  of   a   difference  table.  The difference table used in the
extrapolation of a  sequence  of  4  values,  say  3,  6,   10,   and   15,
might  be displayed as follows:
<p>

<p>
The original sequence of values appears in the  first  column  of  the
table.  Each  entry  in  the  second  column of the table is formed by computing the difference between the adjacent entries in  the  first   column.
These  values  (in  the  second column) are called first differences.  Each
entry in the third column  is  similarly  the difference between the  adjacent 
entries in the second column; the third column entries  are  naturally
called second differences.  Computation  of  the  last   column   in   this
example   should   now   be   obvious   (but  beware that this value is not
always zero).  Note that the last column will always contain only a  single
value.   If  we begin with a sequence of <i>n</i> values, the completed difference
table  will  have  <i>n</i> columns,   with   the   single  value  in  column  <i>n</i>
representing the single <i>n</i>-1st difference.
<p>
<p>
To extrapolate using a difference table we assume the  <i>n</i>-1st   differences  
are  constant  (since  we  have  no additional information to refute
that assumption).  Given that  assumption,  we   can   compute   the   next
entry  in  the <i>n</i>-2nd difference column, the <i>n</i>-3rd difference column, and so
forth until  we  compute  the  next  entry in the first  column  which,  of
course,  is the next value in the  sequence.  The  table  below  shows  the
four additional entries (in boxes) added to the table to compute  the  next
entry   in   the   example   sequence,  which in this case is 21.  We could
obviously  continue  this  extraolation  process  as  far  as  desired   by
adding  additional  entries to the columns using the assumption that the 
<i>n</i>-1st differences are constant.

<p>
     The input for this problem will be a  set  of  extraolation  requests.
For  each   request   the   input   will  contain first an integer <i>n</i>, which
specifies the number of values in the sequence  to  be  extended.  When   <i>n</i>
is  zero your program should terminate.  If <i>n</i> is non-zero (it will never be
larger than 10), it will be  followed   by   <i>n</i>  integers  representing  the
given  elements  in  the  sequence.   The last item in the input  for  each
extrapolation request is <i>k</i>, the number of extrapolation operations to  perform; it will always be at least 1. In  effect,  you are to add <i>k</i> entries
to each column of the difference table, finally reporting the last value of
the  sequence computed by such extrapolation.  More precisely,  assume  the
first  <i>n</i>  entries  (the  given  values)  in  the sequence  are  numbered  1
through  <i>n</i>.
<p>
Your   program  is  to  determine  the  <i>n</i>+<i>k</i>th  value  in  the
sequence  by extrapolation of the original  sequence  <i>k</i>  times.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Hint:</b>  no
upper  limit  is  given  for   <i>k</i>,  and  you  might  not  be able to acquire
enough memory to construct a complete difference table.
