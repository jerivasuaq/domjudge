After making a purchase at a large department store, Mel's change was 17
cents. He received 1 dime, 1 nickel, and 2 pennies. Later that day, he was
shopping at a convenience store. Again his change was 17 cents. This time
he received 2 nickels and 7 pennies. He began to wonder ' &quot;How many
stores can I shop in and receive 17 cents change in a different configuration
of coins? After a suitable mental struggle, he decided the answer was 6.
He then challenged you to consider the general problem.
<p>
<p>
Write a program which will determine the number of different combinations
of US coins (penny: 1c, nickel: 5c, dime: 10c, quarter: 25c, half-dollar: 50c) which may be used to
produce a given amount of money.

<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</a></font></h2>
<p>
The input will consist of a set of numbers between 0 and 30000 inclusive, one
per line in the input file.
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</a></font></h2>
<p>
The output will consist of the appropriate statement from the selection below on a single line in the output file for each input value. The number <i>m</i> is the
number your program computes, <i>n</i> is the input value.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<tt>There are </tt> <i>m</i> <tt>ways to produce </tt> <i>n</i> <tt>cents change.</tt>
<p>
<tt>There is only 1 way to produce </tt> <i>n</i> <tt>cents change.</tt>
