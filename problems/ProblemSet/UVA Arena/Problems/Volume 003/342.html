<p>
This problem requires you to write a program to syntactically validate
some simple text written  using HTML, the HyperText Markup Language in
which all documents available on the World  Wide Web are written. We'll
not consider the semantics, or meaning, of these documents, and will 
only consider simplified syntactical rules.  In these documents you'll
find ordinary text (with arbitrary line lengths) interspersed with
markup  tags.  The markup tags we consider will always occur in pairs. 
An example will illustrate this  point:
<p>
<pre>     This is some ordinary text. &lt;ATAG&gt;  Here's some additional
     text. &lt;BOLD&gt;  This will be boldface. &lt;/BOLD&gt;  Still more 
     &lt;/ATAG&gt;</pre>
<p>
There are two pair of markup tags in the example. The
meaning of <tt>ATAG</tt> and <tt>BOLD</tt> is  unimportant to us in this problem, but
typically a markup tag requests particular treatment of the  text to
which it applies.  The markup tags are easily identified because they
always appear in angle  brackets (that is, a less than symbol and a
greater than symbol).  The tags we'll consider will  always be written
as a sequence of no more than 10 upper-case alphabetic characters.  The
end of  the document region affected by the tag is indicated by a tag
with the same name preceded by a  forward slash, `<tt>/</tt>'  As illustrated,
the tagged regions may encompass more than one line of text.   Also as
shown in the example, the HTML tags must nest properly, just like
<tt>BEGIN...END</tt> pairs in  Pascal, or `<tt>{</tt>' and `<tt>}</tt>' in C/C++.
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</a></font></h2>
<p>
The input will consist of a number of test cases.  Each will begin with
a separate line containing an  integer specifying the number of lines of
text in the test case, <i>NL</i>.  <i>NL</i> will never exceed 32767.   The end of
input is marked by a value of zero (0) for <i>NL</i>.
<p>
<p>
Following the
line specifying <i>NL</i> in each test case there will be <i>NL</i> lines of text
which are to be  checked for syntactic conformance.  Remember that there
is no maximum line length limit.
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</a></font></h2>
<p>
For each test case,
output the test case number (they are numbered sequentially starting
with 1).   If the text is in conformance with the rules specified above,
then output the word ``<tt>OK</tt>&quot;.  If the  text is erroneous, then output one
of the following messages for the first error only:
<p>
<pre>line #: bad character in tag name
line #: too many/few characters in tag name 
line #: expected &lt;/xxxxxxxxxx&gt; 
line #: no matching begin tag.</pre>
<p>
The `<tt>#</tt>' in these messages is to
be replaced by the line number of the test case when the offending  tag
was detected.  Examples of when these messages are displayed are found
in the example input  and expected output immediately following.
<p>
<p>
If an error is detected, after producing the appropriate error
message your program must skip any  remaining lines in the erroneous
test case to reach the beginning of the next test case.

<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001003000000000000000">Sample Input</a></font></h2>
<p>
<pre>6 
This is some ordinary text. 
&lt;BEGIN&gt; This is included in the BEGIN tag &lt;/BEGIN&gt;  
        &lt;START&gt;    Here's some stuff 
and so is this 
 
     more stuff. &lt;/START&gt; 
2 
   This has a null tag &lt;&gt; 
   And an extra line after the error 
5 
   This has some good stuff &lt;OKAY&gt; and some bad stuff later on. 
   &lt;GOOD&gt; All is still okay, but later on we'll have an error. 
   &lt;/GOOD&gt; We're still in the pink! &lt;THISISTOOLONG&gt; 
   This line will be skipped.  
   As will this one. 
1 
   This is an interesting error: &lt;ERROR 
2 
   This one is okay                               &lt;IN&gt; &lt;/IN&gt;

1
   Mismatch &lt;START&gt; &lt;/STOP&gt; 
1 
    Missing start symbol:   &lt;OK&gt;&lt;/OK&gt;&lt;/NOTOK&gt;   more garbage... 
1
&lt;ELEVENChars&gt;Both too long and invalid letter&lt;/ELEVENChars&gt;

&lt;ELEVENCHARs&gt;Both too long and invalid letter&lt;/ELEVENCHARs&gt;
