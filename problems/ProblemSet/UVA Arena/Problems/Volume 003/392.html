<p>
Given the coefficients of a polynomial from degree 8 down to 0, you
are to format the polynomial in a readable format with unnecessary
characters removed.  For instance, given the coefficients 0, 0, 0, 1,
22, -333, 0, 1, and -1, you should generate an output line which
displays <code>x^5 + 22x^4 - 333x^3 + x - 1</code>.
<p>
<p>
The formatting rules which must be adhered to are as follows:
<p>
<ol><li> Terms must appear in decreasing order of degree.<li> Exponents should appear after a caret ``<code>^</code>''.<li> The constant term appears as only the constant.<li> Only terms with nonzero coefficients should appear, unless all terms
have zero coefficients in which case the constant term should appear.<li> The only spaces should be a single space on either side of the
binary + and - operators.<li> If the leading term is positive then no sign should precede it;
a negative leading term should be preceded by a minus sign, as in
<code>-7x^2 + 30x + 66</code>.<li> Negated terms should appear as a subtracted unnegated term (with
the exception of a negative leading term which should appear as
described above).  That is, rather than <code>x^2 + -3x</code>, the output
should be <code>x^2 - 3x</code>.<li> The constants 1 and -1 should appear only as the constant
term.  That is, rather than <code>-1x^3 + 1x^2 + 3x^1 - 1</code>, the output
should appear as <code>-x^3 + x^2 + 3x - 1</code>.

The input file will contain one or more lines of coefficients
delimited by one or more spaces.  There are nine coefficients per
line, each coefficient being an integer with a magnitude of less than
1000.  The output file should contain the formatted polynomials, one
per line.
