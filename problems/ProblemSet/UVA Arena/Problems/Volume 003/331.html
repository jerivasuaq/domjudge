Sorting an array can be done by swapping certain pairs of adjacent entries
in the array.  This is the fundamental technique used in the well-known
bubble sort.  If we list the identities of the pairs to be swapped, in the
sequence they are to be swapped, we obtain what might be called a swap map.
For example, suppose we wish to sort the array A whose elements are 3, 2,
and 1 in that order.  If the subscripts for this array are 1, 2, and 3,
sorting the array can be accomplished by swapping A2 and A3, then swapping A1
and A2, and finally swapping A2 and A3.  If a pair is identified in a swap
map by indicating the subscript of the first element of the pair to be
swapped, then this sorting process would be characterized with the swap map
2 1 2.
<p>
<p>
It is instructive to note that there may be many ways in which swapping of
adjacent array entries can be used to sort an array.  The previous array,
containing 3 2 1, could also be sorted by swapping A1 and A2, then swapping
A2 and A3, and finally swapping A1 and A2 again.  The swap map that describes
this sorting sequence is 1 2 1.
<p>
<p>
For a given array, how many different swap maps exist?  A little thought
will show that there are an infinite number of swap maps, since sequential
swapping of an arbitrary pair of elements will not change the order 
of the elements.  Thus the swap map 1 1 1 2 1 will also leave our array
elements in ascending order.  But how many swap maps of minimum size will
place a given array in order?  That is the question you are to 
answer in this problem.

<p>
The input data will contain an arbitrary number of test cases, followed by a
single 0.  Each test case will have a integer <i>n</i> that gives the size of an
array, and will be followed by the <i>n</i> integer values in the array.
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</a></font></h2>
<p>
For each test case, print a message similar to those shown in the
sample output below.  In no test case will <i>n</i> be larger than 5.
