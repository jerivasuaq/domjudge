Quilters often have to cut fabric into squares.  To do this, they have a
special tool (called a rotary cutter) that can cut through many layers
of fabric at a time.  The exact number of layers depends on the type of fabric
being cut.  In using a rotary cutter,
the problem is not how long the cut needs to be
(it is just as easy to make a cut one centimeter
long as it is to make a cut 20 centimeters
long), but how many cuts need to be made.
<p>
<p>
For example, to cut a 2 by 3 piece of fabric into 1 by
1 squares takes five cuts if only one layer of fabric may be cut at a time:

<p>
If two layers may be cut at a time, it will only
take three cuts (the two pieces of fabric can be placed on
top of each other after the first cut, so when the
second and third cuts are made, they
will also make the fourth and fifth cuts).
<p>
<p>
In cutting fabric, pieces may be placed on
top of each other.  Pieces do not need to be of
identical shapes to be put on top of
each other.  For example, if the fabric above had first been cut vertically,
a 1 by 2 piece could have been put on top of the 2 by
2 piece.  Fabric may be rearranged between
cuts.  Fabric can not be folded.  For
example, to cut a 1 by 3 piece of fabric into
squares will take 2 cuts, not 1 (if the fabric
were folded in half before cutting).
Quilters are thrifty people so they never have any waste: if a piece of fabric
is <i>m</i> by <i>n</i>, they will get <i>mn</i> pieces from it.
<p>
<p>
Write a program to determine the fewest cuts necessary to cut a piece
of fabric into squares.

<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</a></font></h2>
<p>
The input will consist of a number of lines.  Each line will have 3 integers
describing the fabric to be cut. The first is the maximum number
of layers that can be cut at a time (between 1 and 200) and the last two
are the dimensions (between 1 and 20 in each dimension).
<p>
<p>
A line consisting of the values 0 0 0 will mark the end of input.
This line should not be processed.
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</a></font></h2>
<p>
For each line, echo the dimensions and give the smallest number of cuts
that are necessary to cut it entirely into 1 by 1 squares.  Use the format
given in the Sample Output below.
<p>
<p>
Leave a blank line after each line of output.
