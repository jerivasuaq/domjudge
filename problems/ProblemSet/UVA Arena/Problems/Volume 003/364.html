<blockquote> <em>Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the several States
which may be included in this Union, according to their respective
Numbers... The Number of Representatives shall
not exceed one for every thirty thousand, but
each State shall have at least one representative.</em>
<p>
Article I, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution
<p>
</blockquote>
<p>
When the writers of the U.S. Constitution wrote those words in Philadelphia
in 1787, they could not have foreseen the trouble
they would cause mathematicians.
There are numerous different interpretations
of how to ``apportion according to respective
Number&quot;.  For more than 100 years there
was debate as to how to do this apportionment, because
different apportionment methods tend to favor
different states.  Fortunately,
we have computers and can easily compare some
of the more popular apportionment methods.
Your program should compute the number
of representatives each state will get from the
methods and tell which if any of the apportionments
will give the state more representatives.
<p>
<p>
Suppose there were five states in the union:
Anxiety, Boredom, Confusion, Dismay, and Ecstasy,
with the following populations (given in thousands):
<p>
<p>
<p> <img width="120" height="103" align="BOTTOM" alt="tabular24" src="364img1.gif"> <p>
<p>
<p>
The total population of this country then is 630 thousand. For a house
of 30 representatives, each representative
should represent 21 thousand people (notice
we have relaxed the constitutional requirement
of at most one representative
for each 30,000), so the true apportionment of representatives would be:
<p>
<p>
<p> <img width="134" height="103" align="BOTTOM" alt="tabular29" src="364img2.gif"> <p>
<p>
<p>
Unfortunately, it is impossible to send half of a representative to Congress,
so there needs to be away of dividing the 30 seats, giving just a positive
integral number of representatives
to each state. (All states must have at least one representative.)
<p>
<p>
There are four major apportionment methods: the
Hamilton Method, the Jefferson Method, the Adams
method, and the Webster method.  The Hamilton method
starts with the true apportionment and gives
each state the whole number corresponding
to the true value, so Anxiety will get 2 representatives, Boredom will get
8, etc.  States with less than one representative
will get one representative.  Then, if there are any representatives left over,
they will go to the states in the order of
the fractional part (states with true apportionment less than one are not considered), 
where the state with the largest fractional part
(in this case, Dismay with a fractional part of 0.57)
will get the first of the extra representatives,
and the second of the extra representatives
will go to the state with the second largest
fraction (Confusion, with a fractional part of 0.52), etc.
<p>
<p>
The other three methods will not necessarily use the
divisor given by dividing the total population by
the number of seats. Instead, they use different
divisors to give the desired number of representatives,
making sure each state has at least one representative.
The Jefferson Method will find a divisor so the sum
of the truncated quotients gives the desired number
of representatives.  19,750 is a possible
divisor for the example using the Jefferson method.
Dividing by 19,750 gives the following quotients and truncating
the quotients gives the number of representatives.
<p>
<p>
<p> <img width="393" height="126" align="BOTTOM" alt="tabular34" src="364img3.gif"> <p>
<p>
<p>
The Adams Method also looks for a divisor
to come up with the desired number of representatives, but will round
<b>up</b> instead of truncate.  One possible
divisor for the Adams Method with this example would be 23,000.  Dividing
by 23,000 gives the following quotients
and rounding up gives the number of representatives.
<p>
<p>
<p> <img width="393" height="126" align="BOTTOM" alt="tabular40" src="364img4.gif"> <p>
<p>
<p>
Finally, the Webster Method finds a divisor
so when the quotient is rounded (using
standard rounding rules, where fractional
parts of 0.5 or greater round up and fractional
parts of less than 0.5 round down), the sum
of the quotients is the desired number of representatives. In this case, a
divisor of 21,000 could be used for the Webster method, giving the same
number of representatives as the Hamilton method, but
<em>this is not always the case</em>.

<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</a></font></h2>
<p>
The input for this program will be zero or more data sets.  The first line
of each data set will be the number of states
in the set. There will be at most 50 states in the data. There will then be
one line for each state, giving the state
name (a string of exactly 5 characters starting
in column1), at least one blank, and the population (a positive integer).
After the information about the states
will be one or more integers, one per line,
representing the number of representatives.
You may assume this will always be greater than or equal to the number of
states, so each state is guaranteed to have at least
one representative.  The end of the number
of representatives is indicated by 0 as a number of representatives.
<p>
<p>
The end of input is indicated by a data set with 0 states.
This input set should not be processed.

<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</a></font></h2>
<p>
Before each set of data, give the number
of the data set.  For each number of representatives,
echo the number of representatives and for
each state, tell if there is an apportionment method that
gives the state more representatives than
the other methods.  You may assume the algorithms will
work for the input data as described above.
Use the format of the Sample Output below.
Leave a blank line after each number of representatives.
