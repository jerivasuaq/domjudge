The two properties of arithmetic operators which determine the order in
which they are executed in an expression are their precedence
levels and their associativities. Precedence levels determine the order in
which operators with different precedence levels are executed.
Associativities determine the order in which a repeated operator is
executed. Left associative operators are evaluated left to right while
right associative operators are evaluated right to left. Different operators
with equal precedence levels are evaluated left to right.
Examples:
<p>
<ul><li> If the precedence level of <tt>*</tt> is higher than that of <tt>+</tt>, the
expression 5*3+4 would evaluate to 19.<li> If the precedence level of <tt>+</tt> is higher than that of <tt>*</tt>, the expression 5*3+4 would evaluate to 35.<li> Left-associativity of <tt>-</tt> would cause the expression
3-2-1 to be interpreted as (3-2)-1 which evaluates to 0.<li> Right-associativity of <tt>-</tt> would cause 3-2-1 to be interpreted as
3-(2-1) which evaluates to 2.
</li></li></li></li></ul>
<p>
In the Southeastern region of the planet ACM, a strange collection of
dialects has resulted in the use of non-standard operators for the
integer operations of plus, minus, times, and integer divide. The
operations are the usual binary operations, but the symbols used, their
precedences and their associativities, vary widely across the region.
Your team is to write a program that will implement a simple integer
calculator with operations &quot;<tt>+</tt>&quot;, &quot;<tt>-</tt>&quot;, &quot;<tt>*</tt>&quot;, and &quot;<tt>/</tt>&quot; where &quot;<tt>/</tt>&quot; denotes integer division. The catch is, your calculator has to deal with all of the local dialects.

<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</a></font></h2>
<p>
The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating the number of the cases following, each of them as described below. This line is followed by a blank line, and there is also a blank line between two consecutive inputs.<br>
The input for each case will contain 4 lines that describe the local symbol set
followed by 1 or more lines each containing an expression using the
local symbol set to be evaluated. The first four lines each contain a
four character string  <img width="56" height="16" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline45" src="354img1.gif">  beginning in column one, where:
<p>
<dl compact=""><dt><strong></strong>
<dd>  <img width="13" height="17" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline47" src="354img2.gif">  denotes the standard operator that is being described
<p>
<dt><strong></strong>
<dd>  <img width="13" height="17" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline49" src="354img3.gif">  denotes the local symbol being used for that operator
<p>
<dt><strong></strong>
<dd>  <img width="13" height="17" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline51" src="354img4.gif">  is a digit denoting the local precedence of the operator (higher digit means higher precedence)
<p>
<dt><strong></strong>
<dd>  <img width="13" height="17" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline53" src="354img5.gif">  is a single letter denoting the local associativity of the
operator (<tt>L</tt> for left associativity, <tt>R</tt> for right).
<p>
 </dd></dt></dd></dt></dd></dt></dd></dt></dl>
<p>
The line
<p>
<pre>-@1R</pre>
<p>
means that the symbol <tt>@</tt> will be used to denote minus which will be right
associative and have precedence 1. The expression
5@3@1 under these circumstances will evaluate to 3.
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</a></font></h2>
<p>
For each input expression, your program must print one line containing
the expression with standard operators followed by a
space, an equal sign, and the result.<br>
The outputs of two consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.

The last expression, parenthesized to show you the order of
execution is (2+((3*12)/(6/(5-3)))).

<ul>
<li>operators were selected from the set <pre>~@#$%^&amp;*()_+=-{}[]:;|&lt;&gt;,.?/</pre>
  and the four operators for the arithmetic operations are unique.
  
<li>numbers in the input have no leading zeros.

<li>lines are max. 1024 characters long.

<li>input numbers, answers and intermediate results all fit into 32-bit signed integers.
