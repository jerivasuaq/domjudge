<p>Old MacDonald has a farm and on this farm he has a cow - and a fenced 
circular pasture with a radius of 100 yards. He plans to tie the cow to a post 
on the circunference of the pasture. He wants the cow to be able to eat one third 
of the grass in the pasture. How long should the rope be? 
<p>
<p>You must solve a generalization of this problem. 
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070e8"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input and 
Output</a></font></h2>
<p>The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself 
indicating the number of the cases following, each of them as described below. 
This line is followed by a blank line, and there is also a blank line between 
two consecutive inputs.<br>Write a program which will input two numbers, 
<i>R</i> (<em>radius</em> - an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive) and 
<i>P</i> (<em>part of</em> - a real number between 0.0 and 0.5 inclusive) and 
solve old MacDonald's problem. How long a rope should old MacDonald use to allow 
the cow to eat <i>P</i> of the grass in the circular pasture of radius <i>R</i>. 
Express your answer correct to two decimal places. 
<p>
<p>For each test case, output a statement in the format shown in the sample 
output below. The number P and the answer shall be rounded to two decimal places.
The outputs of two consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.<br>
<p>Note: recommended value for PI is 2*acos(0), but any value within 1e-10 of
the exact value of PI will lead you to the expected answer.
