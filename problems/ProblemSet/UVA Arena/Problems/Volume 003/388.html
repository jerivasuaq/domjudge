With the introduction of the new ThrustoZoom gigadimensional drive, it has
become possible for
HyperCommodities, the import/export conglomerate from New Jersey, to
begin trading with even
the most remote galaxies in the universe. HyperCommodities wants to
import goods from some
of the galaxies in the Plural Z sector. Planets within these galaxies
export valuable products and
raw materials like vacuuseal, transparent aluminum, digraphite, and
quantum steel. Preliminary reports have revealed the following facts:
<p>
<ul><li> Each galaxy contains at least one and at most 26 planets. Each
planet within a galaxy is identified by a unique letter from A to Z.<li> Each planet specializes in the production and export of one good.
Different planets within the same galaxy export different goods.<li> Some pairs of planets are connected by hyperspace shipping lines.
If planets A and B are
connected, they can trade goods freely. If planet C is connected to B
but not to A, then A
and C can still trade goods with each other through B, but B
keeps 5% of the shipment as a
shipping fee. (Thus A only receives 95% of what C shipped, and C
receives only 95% of what
A shipped.) In general, any two planets can trade goods as long as
they are connected by
some set of shipping lines, but each intermediate planet along the
shipping route keeps 5% of what it shipped (which is not
necessarily equal to 5% of the original shipment).<li> At least one planet in each galaxy is willing to open a ThrustoZoom
shipping line to Earth. A
ThrustoZoom line is the same as any other shipping line within
the galaxy, as far as business
is concerned. For example, if planet K opens a ThrustoZoom line to Earth,
then the Earth
can trade goods freely with K, or it can trade goods with any planet
connected to K, subject to the usual shipping fees.
</li></li></li></li></ul>
<p>
HyperCommodities has assigned a relative value (a positive real
number less than 10) to each
planet's chief export. The higher the number, the more valuable the
product. More valuable
products can be resold with a higher profit margin in domestic
markets. The problem is to determine
which planet has the most valuable export when shipping fees
are taken into account.
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</a></font></h2>
<p>
The input consists of one or more galaxy descriptions. Each galaxy
description begins with a line
containing an integer <i>N</i> which specifies the number of planets in the galaxy. The next <i>N</i> lines contain descriptions of each planet, which consist of:
<p>
<ol><li> The letter used to represent the planet.<li> A space.<li> The relative value of the planet's export, in the form <i>d</i>.<i>dd</i>.<li> A space.<li> A string containing letters and/or the character `<tt>*</tt>'; a letter
indicates a shipping line to that
planet, and a `<tt>*</tt>' indicates a willingness to open a ThrustoZoom
shipping line to Earth.
</li></li></li></li></li></ol><h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</a></font></h2>
<p>
For each galaxy description, output a single line which reads
``<tt>Import from</tt> P'' where P is the letter
of the planet with the most valuable export, once shipping fees have
been taken into account. (If
more than one planet have the same most valuable export value then
output the plant which is alphabetically first).
