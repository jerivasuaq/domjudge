<p>
Virtually all text-mode terminals are special-purpose computer systems,
including a serial port (for communication with a modem or another computer
system), a keyboard, a CRT, and of course, a microprocessor, some RAM, and a
control program in ROM.
<p>
When a character arrives at the terminal, either from the keyboard or the
serial port, the terminal's software classifies it as either a display
character (which is to be displayed on the CRT) or as a character that 
introduces a control sequence.  A control sequence is used to direct the
terminal to do such things as clear the screen, move the cursor in a specified
manner, or perhaps change fonts.
<p>
In this problem assume you are writing the software for a small terminal with
a 10-row, 10-column display (perhaps for a point-of-sale terminal).  Rows and
columns are numbered 0 through 9.  The character that introduces a control
sequence is  <img width="7" height="7" align="BOTTOM" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline39" src="337img1.gif"> , the circumflex. The character (or in one case, the two
characters) immediately following the control sequence introducer will direct
your software in performing its special functions.  Here is the complete
list of control sequences you will need to interpret:
<p>
<dl><dt><strong> <img width="7" height="7" align="BOTTOM" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline39" src="337img1.gif"> <tt>b</tt></strong>
<dd>
<p>
  Move the cursor to the beginning of the current line; the cursor row does not change
<p>
<dt><strong> <img width="7" height="7" align="BOTTOM" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline39" src="337img1.gif"> <tt>c</tt></strong>
<dd>
  Clear the entire screen; the cursor row and column do not change
<p>
<dt><strong> <img width="7" height="7" align="BOTTOM" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline39" src="337img1.gif"> <tt>d</tt></strong>
<dd>
  Move the cursor down one row if possible; the cursor column does not change
<p>
<dt><strong> <img width="7" height="7" align="BOTTOM" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline39" src="337img1.gif"> <tt>e</tt></strong>
<dd>
  Erase characters to the right of, and including, the cursor column on
    the cursor's row; the cursor row and column do not change
<p>
<dt><strong> <img width="7" height="7" align="BOTTOM" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline39" src="337img1.gif"> <tt>h</tt></strong>
<dd>
  Move the cursor to row 0, column 0; the image on the screen is not changed
<p>
<dt><strong> <img width="7" height="7" align="BOTTOM" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline39" src="337img1.gif"> <tt>i</tt></strong>
<dd>
  Enter insert mode (see below)
<p>
<dt><strong> <img width="7" height="7" align="BOTTOM" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline39" src="337img1.gif"> <tt>l</tt></strong>
<dd>
  Move the cursor left one column, if possible; the cursor row does
    not change
<p>
<dt><strong> <img width="7" height="7" align="BOTTOM" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline39" src="337img1.gif"> <tt>o</tt></strong>
<dd>
  Enter overwrite mode (see below)
<p>
<dt><strong> <img width="7" height="7" align="BOTTOM" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline39" src="337img1.gif"> <tt>r</tt></strong>
<dd>
  Move the cursor right one column, if possible; the cursor row does
    not change
<p>
<dt><strong> <img width="7" height="7" align="BOTTOM" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline39" src="337img1.gif"> <tt>u</tt></strong>
<dd>
  Move the cursor up one row, if possible; the cursor column does not change
<p>
<dt><strong> <img width="17" height="7" align="BOTTOM" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline61" src="337img2.gif"> </strong>
<dd>
  Write a circumflex ( <img width="7" height="7" align="BOTTOM" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline39" src="337img1.gif"> ) at the current cursor location, exactly as if it was not a special character; this is subject to the actions of the current
    mode (insert or overwrite)
<p>
<dt><strong> <img width="7" height="7" align="BOTTOM" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline39" src="337img1.gif">  <tt>##</tt></strong>
<dd>
 Move the cursor to the row and column specified; # represents a decimal
    digit; the first # represents the new row number, and the second #
    represents the new column number
<p>
 </dd></dt></dd></dt></dd></dt></dd></dt></dd></dt></dd></dt></dd></dt></dd></dt></dd></dt></dd></dt></dd></dt></dd></dt></dl>
<p>
No illegal control sequences will ever be sent to the terminal.  The cursor
cannot move outside the allowed screen locations (that is, between row 0,
column 0 and row 9, column 9).
<p>
<p>
When a normal character (not part of a control sequence) arrives at the
terminal, it is displayed on the terminal screen in a manner that depends on
the terminal mode.  When the terminal is in overwrite mode (as it is when it
is first turned on), the received character replaces the character at the
cursor's location.  But when the terminal is in insert mode, the characters
to the right of and including the cursor's location are shifted right one
column, and the new character is placed at the cursor's location; the
character previously in the rightmost column of the cursor's row is lost.
Regardless of the mode, the cursor is moved right one column, if possible.
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</a></font></h2>
<p>
The input will contain multiple tests of your terminal software.  Each test
begins with a line containing an integer <i>N</i>.  Following this line there will
be <i>N</i> more lines of data, each character of which is to be treated as 
if it was input, in the order read, to your terminal software.  There will be
no tab characters in the input data, and ends of lines in the input are to be
ignored.  Note that blanks in the input data are normal characters to 
be displayed on your terminal's screen.  The last test will be followed by a
single line containing the integer 0.  No control sequence will be split
between two lines of the input data.
<p>
<p>
At the beginning of each test case you are to assume the terminal screen is
clear (that is, filled with blanks), that the terminal is in overwrite mode,
and that the cursor is in row 0, column 0 of the screen.
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</a></font></h2>
<p>
For each input test case, output a line with the case number (these are
numbered sequentially starting with 1) and the screen image the way it would
look at the end of processing the data in the test case.  Enclose the 
screen image in a &quot;box;&quot; see the sample below for illustration of the required
format.
