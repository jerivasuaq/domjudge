One important problem in concurrent programming is to ensure exclusive access to 
shared resources by multiple threads. It is also known as Mutual Exclusion protocol. 
A code that needs to be protected from concurrent execution is called 
<span class="textit">critical section</span> (<span class="textit">CS</span>). In order to coordinate access to CS, application threads use
a set of shared variables to send information to each other. These shared variables 
are distinct from all the variables that are used by application code. In practice, 
mutual exclusion protocol is implemented as two methods -- <span class="textit">enterCS</span> and
<span class="textit">exitCS</span>. When application needs to execute
some code in CS, it calls enterCS, then executes CS, then calls exitCS. 

For theoretical analysis of mutual exclusion protocol one must consider running
application as a whole. Each thread of application is represented
as an infinite loop that repeatedly performs some work unrelated to CS, which is called
<span class="textit">non-critical section</span> (<span class="textit">NCS</span>), then calls enterCS, then executes CS, then calls exitCS, 
then the loop repeats. The code inside NCS and CS is not relevant; it is considered to 
perform no operations related to the protocol and does not modify shared variables used by the protocol.

We consider a system with two concurrently running threads. Threads
use a set of shared one-bit variables to implement mutual exclusion protocol. 
Each variable can store a value of zero or one that can be read or written by a single instruction. 
Shared variables are initialized to zero.
Each thread has a local pointer to the instruction (<span class="textit">IP</span>) that it is going to execute 
next. Execution starts from the top of the code. During each step of execution one of the 
threads is arbitrarily chosen, it executes one instruction, and then changes its IP
to the next instruction to execute. 
This infinite sequence of steps is called <span class="textit">history</span>.
A history is called <span class="textit">legal</span> if either both threads execute infinitely many steps or just one thread 
does, while the other thread, having taken a finite number of steps, stops with IP at NCS.

The table below contains several algorithms in pseudo-code that attempt to implement mutual exclusion protocol.
In this pseudo-code <span class="textit">id</span> is 0 for the first thread and 1 for the second. Variables
<span class="textit">want</span>[0], <span class="textit">want</span>[1], and <span class="textit">turn</span> are shared between threads to implement mutual 
exclusion protocol. Lines marked with ``<code>+</code>'' implement enterCS, lines marked with ``<code>-</code>''
implement exitCS. Lines NCS() and CS() are placeholders for some code that works inside non-critical and critical 
sections respectively and is not relevant for this problem.

The task is to figure out if the given algorithm satisfies three important properties:

<ul>
<li>The algorithm satisfies <span class="textit">mutual exclusion</span> if in any legal history CS is not executed
concurrently by two threads (that is, there is no step where IP of both threads is at CS).
</li>
<li>The algorithm satisfies <span class="textit">deadlock freedom</span> if any legal history has infinitely many
executions of CS. 
</li>
<li>The algorithm satisfies <span class="textit">starvation freedom</span> if in any legal history
a thread that executes infinitely many steps has infinitely many executions of CS.
</li>
</ul>

The property of mutual exclusion is trivial. 
The algorithm that simply loops forever doing nothing will satisfy it.
The sample algorithms above all satisfy mutual exclusion, but the first two fail to achieve deadlock freedom.
The algorithm 3 (originally created by Gary Peterson) satisfies all three properties.

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

The input file contains several test cases, each of them    as described below.

The input starts with a line with two integer numbers -- <span class="MATH"><i>m</i><sub>1</sub></span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> and <span class="MATH"><i>m</i><sub>2</sub></span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, where <span class="MATH"><i>m</i><sub>i</sub></span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> 
is the number of lines of code for <span class="MATH"><i>i</i></span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>-th thread (
<span class="MATH">2<img width="18" height="31" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="4375img1.png" alt="$ \le$"><i>m</i><sub>i</sub><img width="18" height="31" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="4375img1.png" alt="$ \le$">9</span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>). 
It is followed by <span class="MATH"><i>m</i><sub>1</sub></span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> lines with the code for the first thread and <span class="MATH"><i>m</i><sub>2</sub></span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> lines with the code for the
second thread. 

The code for each thread contains one instruction per line. Instruction starts
with an integer line number from <span class="MATH">1</span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> to <span class="MATH"><i>m</i><sub>i</sub></span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> (lines are numbered in ascending order and are included
to aid readability), 
followed by instruction mnemonic, 
followed by a list of instruction arguments, all separated by spaces. 
The last arguments of instruction 
represent line numbers of the next instructions to execute (<span class="textit">NIP</span> -- from 1 to <span class="MATH"><i>m</i><sub>i</sub></span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>). 
There are three variables shared between 
threads -- A, B, and C. Instruction mnemonics are:

<ul>
<li>NCS -- non-critical section placeholder. Its single argument is NIP.
</li>
<li>CS -- critical section placeholder. Its single argument is NIP.
</li>
<li>SET -- write value to the shared variable. It has three arguments <span class="MATH"><i>v</i></span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, <span class="MATH"><i>x</i></span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, and <span class="MATH"><i>g</i></span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>,
where <span class="MATH"><i>v</i></span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> is the variable to write (A, B, or C), <span class="MATH"><i>x</i></span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> is the value to write (0 or 1), and <span class="MATH"><i>g</i></span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> is NIP.
</tex2html_verbatim_mark></tex2html_verbatim_mark></tex2html_verbatim_mark></tex2html_verbatim_mark></tex2html_verbatim_mark></tex2html_verbatim_mark></li>
<li>TEST -- read and test the value of the shared variable. It has three arguments <span class="MATH"><i>v</i></span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, <span class="MATH"><i>g</i><sub>0</sub></span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>, and <span class="MATH"><i>g</i><sub>1</sub></span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>
where <span class="MATH"><i>v</i></span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> is the variable to read (A, B, or C), 
<span class="MATH"><i>g</i><sub>0</sub></span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> is NIP if the value of the variable is zero, and
<span class="MATH"><i>g</i><sub>1</sub></span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> is NIP if the value of the variable is one.

</ul>

NCS and CS appear in the code for each thread exactly once. The code may or may not represent a simple loop, but 
is guaranteed to alternate
executions of CS and NCS by one thread, that is, in every legal history two executions of CS by one thread always 
have NCS execution by the same thread in between and, vice versa, two executions of NCS by one thread
have CS execution by the same thread in between.

Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

For each test case, write to the output a string of three letters on a line by itself. Letters represent properties 
of mutual exclusion, deadlock freedom, and starvation freedom.
Write letter Y if the corresponding property is satisfied and N otherwise.

<p>
<br>

<b>Note:</b>

Three first samples below represent algorithms 1-3 from the problem statement.

The fourth one is an algorithm (originally created by Leslie Lamport) that uses just two shared bits 
(A and B) and satisfies mutual exclusion and deadlock freedom, but is not free from starvation.

Last two are trivial algorithms. First one never executes CS nor NCS and thus guarantees mutual exclusion,
but does not have deadlock freedom, nor starvation freedom properties. Second one loops between NCS and CS, thus
fails to achieve mutual exclusion, but is free from deadlock and starvation.
