Bob is a skilled engineer. He must design a highway that crosses a region with few villages. Since this region is quite unpopulated, he wants to minimize the number of exits from the highway. He models the highway as a line segment <span class="MATH"><i>S</i></span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> (starting from zero), the villages as points on a plane, and the exits as points on <span class="MATH"><i>S</i></span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>. Considering that the highway and the villages position are known, Bob must find the minimum number of exists such that each village location is at most at the distance <span class="MATH"><i>D</i></span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> from at least one exit. He knows that all village locations are at most at the distance <span class="MATH"><i>D</i></span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> from <span class="MATH"><i>S</i></span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>.

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
The program input is from the standard input. Each data set in the file stands for a particular set of a highway and the positions of the villages. The data set starts with the length <span class="MATH"><i>L</i></span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> (fits an integer) of the highway. Follows the distance <span class="MATH"><i>D</i></span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> (fits an integer), the number <span class="MATH"><i>N</i></span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> of villages, and for each village the location <span class="MATH">(<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>)</span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>. The program prints the minimum number of exits. White spaces can occur freely in the input. The input data are correct and terminate with an end of file.

Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
For each set of data the program prints the result to the standard output from the beginning of a line. 

<p>
An input/output sample is in the table below. There is a single data set. The highway length <span class="MATH"><i>L</i></span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> is 100, the distance <span class="MATH"><i>D</i></span>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark> is 50. There are 3 villages having the locations (2, 4), (50, 10), (70, 30). The result for the data set is the minimum number of exits: 1.
