<p>Let us define a regular brackets sequence in the following way:</p>

<ol>
<li>Empty sequence is a regular sequence.</li>
<li>If S is a regular sequence, then (S) and [S] are both regular sequences.</li>
<li>If A and B are regular sequences, then AB is a regular sequence.</li>
</ol>

<p>For example, all of the following sequences of characters are regular 
brackets sequences:</p>

<p><tt>()</tt>, <tt>[]</tt>, <tt>(())</tt>, <tt>([])</tt>, <tt>()[]</tt>, <tt>()[()]</tt></p>

<p>And all of the following character sequences are not:</p>

<p><tt>(</tt>, <tt>[</tt>, <tt>)</tt>, <tt>)(</tt>, <tt>([)]</tt>, <tt>([(]</tt></p>

<p>Some sequence of characters '(', ')', '[', and ']' is given. You are to find
the shortest possible regular brackets sequence, that contains the given
character sequence as a subsequence. Here, a string
a<sub>1</sub>a<sub>2</sub>...a<sub>n</sub> is called a subsequence of the string
b<sub>1</sub>b<sub>2</sub>...b<sub>m</sub>, if there exist such indices
1 &le; i<sub>1</sub> &lt; i<sub>2</sub> &lt; ... &lt; i<sub>n</sub> &le; m,
that a<sub>j</sub>=b<sub>i<sub>j</sub></sub> for all 1 &le; j &le; n.</p>

The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating
the number of the cases following, each of them as described below.
This line is followed by a blank line, and there is also a blank line between
two consecutive inputs.

<p>
<p>
<p>The input file contains at most 100 brackets (characters '(', ')', '[' and ']')
that are situated on a single line without any other characters among them.</p>
