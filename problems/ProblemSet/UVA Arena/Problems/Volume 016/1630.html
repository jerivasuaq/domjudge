Bill is trying to compactly represent sequences of capital alphabetic
characters from `<tt>A</tt>' to `<tt>Z</tt>' by folding repeating subsequences inside them.
For example, one way to represent a sequence `<tt>AAAAAAAAAABABABCCD</tt>' is
`<tt>10(A)2(BA)B2(C)D</tt>'. He formally defines folded sequences of characters
along with the unfolding transformation for them in the following way:

<ul>
<li>A sequence that contains a single character from `<tt>A</tt>' to `<tt>Z</tt>' is
considered to be a folded sequence. Unfolding of this sequence
produces the same sequence of a single character itself.
</li>
<li>If <span class="MATH"><i>S</i></span> and <span class="MATH"><i>Q</i></span> are folded sequences, then <span class="MATH"><i>SQ</i></span> is also a folded sequence.
If <span class="MATH"><i>S</i></span> unfolds to <span class="MATH"><i>S'</i></span> and <span class="MATH"><i>Q</i></span> unfolds to <span class="MATH"><i>Q'</i></span>, then <span class="MATH"><i>SQ</i></span> unfolds to <span class="MATH"><i>S'Q'</i></span>.
</li>
<li>If <span class="MATH"><i>S</i></span> is a folded sequence, then <span class="MATH"><i>X</i>(<i>S</i>)</span> is also a folded sequence,
where <span class="MATH"><i>X</i></span> is a decimal representation of an integer number greater than 1.
If <span class="MATH"><i>S</i></span> unfolds to <span class="MATH"><i>S'</i></span>, then <span class="MATH"><i>X</i>(<i>S</i>)</span> unfolds to <span class="MATH"><i>S'</i></span> repeated <span class="MATH"><i>X</i></span> times.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
According to this definition it is easy to unfold any given folded
sequence. However, Bill is much more interested in the reverse
transformation. He wants to fold the given sequence in such a way that
the resulting folded sequence contains the least possible number of
characters.

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>
Input file contains several test cases, one per line. Each of them
contains a single line of characters from `<tt>A</tt>' to `<tt>Z</tt>'
with at least 1 and at most 100 characters.

<p>

<h2><font size="4" color="#ff0000"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">
Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>
For each input case write a different output line.
This must be a single line that contains the shortest
possible folded sequence that unfolds to the sequence that is given
in the input file. If there are many such sequences then write
any one of them.
