<p>
The WormWold puzzle was initially proposed by Cliff Pickover in
the Discover Magazine, issue of November 1994 (a visit to his home
page is highly recommended!). The WormWorld is a grid of numbers
and it is a tough place to live in. The worms that inhabit it are
all born with nasty allergies. The first time they come in contact
with a number, their immune systems are overstimulated; if they
are exposed to that number a second time, they die of anaphylactic
shock.

<p>
A worm can start crawling on any square in WormWorld, and it can
then move horizontally or vertically but not diagonally.  In this
scenario, what is the longest path a worm can take without dying?
An example is illustrated in the following figure.

<p>
<div align="CENTER">

</div>

<p>
Write a program that determines the largest path a worm can take
for a given grid.

<p>

<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">
Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
<b>The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating
the number of the cases following, each of them as described below.
This line is followed by a blank line, and there is also a blank line between
two consecutive inputs.
</b>

<p>

<p><p>
<br>

<p>
The first input line is the size <span class="MATH"><i>N</i></span> of the grid (
<span class="MATH">0 &lt; <i>N</i><img width="18" height="30" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="838img2.png" alt="$ \le$">12</span>). This is followed by <span class="MATH"><i>N</i></span> input lines, each one with
<span class="MATH"><i>N</i></span> positive integer values separated by blank spaces (as a
simplification, we will only use grid values less then 1000).

<p>

Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
<b>For each test case, the output must follow the description below.
The outputs of two consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.
</b>

<p>

<p>
The output is the size (in terms of the number of squares) of the
largest path that a worm can take.
