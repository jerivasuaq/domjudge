Before being an ubiquous communications gadget, a <em>mobile</em> was
just a structure made of strings and wires suspending colourfull
things. This kind of mobile is usually found hanging over cradles
of small babies.

<p>
<div align="CENTER">

</div>

<p>
The figure illustrates a simple mobile. It is just a wire,
suspended by a string, with an object on each side. It can also be
seen as a kind of lever with the fulcrum on the point where the
string ties the wire.  From the lever principle we know that to
balance a simple mobile the product of the weight of the objects
by their distance to the fulcrum must be equal. That is

<span class="MATH"><i>W</i><sub>l</sub>&#215;<i>D</i><sub>l</sub> = <i>W</i><sub>r</sub>&#215;<i>D</i><sub>r</sub></span>
where <span class="MATH"><i>D</i><sub>l</sub></span> is the left distance, <span class="MATH"><i>D</i><sub>r</sub></span> is the
right distance, <span class="MATH"><i>W</i><sub>l</sub></span> is the left weight and <span class="MATH"><i>W</i><sub>r</sub></span>
is the right weight.

<p>

<p>
<br>
In a more complex mobile the object may be replaced by a
sub-mobile, as shown in the next figure. In this case it is not so
straightforward to check if the mobile is balanced so we need you
to write a program that, given a description of a mobile as input,
checks whether the mobile is in equilibrium or not.

<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">
Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
<b>The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating
the number of the cases following, each of them as described below.
This line is followed by a blank line, and there is also a blank line between
two consecutive inputs.
</b>

<p>

<p><p>
<br>

<p>
The input is composed of several lines, each containing 4 integers
separated by a single  space. The 4 integers represent the
distances of each object to the fulcrum and their  weights, in the
format: 
<span class="MATH"><i>W</i><sub>l</sub>&nbsp;<i>D</i><sub>l</sub>&nbsp;<i>W</i><sub>r</sub>&nbsp;<i>D</i><sub>r</sub></span>

<p>
If <span class="MATH"><i>W</i><sub>l</sub></span> or <span class="MATH"><i>W</i><sub>r</sub></span> is zero then there is a sub-mobile hanging from
that end and the following lines define the the sub-mobile. In
this case we compute the weight of the sub-mobile as the sum of
weights of all its objects, disregarding the weight of the wires
and strings. If both <span class="MATH"><i>W</i><sub>l</sub></span> and <span class="MATH"><i>W</i><sub>r</sub></span> are zero then the following
lines define two sub-mobiles: first the left then the right one.

<p>
Write `<tt>YES</tt>' if the mobile is in equilibrium, write `<tt>NO</tt>' otherwise.
