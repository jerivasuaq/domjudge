<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; An electronic circuit consists of components, pins, and wires. Figure
1 shows a circuit with the three components A, B, and C. Each wire
connects a pair of pins. Two pins a and b are <b>electrically
equivalent</b> if they are either connected by a wire or there is a
sequence <i>a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, ..., a<sub>k</sub></i> of pins such that <i>a,a<sub>1</sub>; 
a<sub>1</sub>,a<sub>2</sub>; ...; a<sub>k-1</sub>,a<sub>k</sub>;</i>  and <i>a_k, b</i>
are all connected by wires. A <b>net</b> is a maximal set of electrically equivalent
pins. <i>Maximal</i> means that no pin outside the net is electrically
equivalent to a pin in the net.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Given a set of pins and a set of wires your task is to determine the
number of nets defined within the circuit. Figure 2 illustrates a circuit
with 3 nets.

<b>
The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating
the number of the cases following, each of them as described below.
This line is followed by a blank line, and there is also a blank line between
two consecutive inputs.
</b>
<p>
<p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The sequence of pins is always numbered from 1 to N. The first
input value is the value of N. The sequence of wires is described by
pairs of pin values. It is given at the input as sequence of numbers,
separated by a space. The first two numbers define the first pair, the
two numbers that follow define the second pair, and so on. The input
ends with the end_of_file mark.

<b>
For each test case, the output must follow the description below.
The outputs of two consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.
</b>
<p>
<p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The output is just the number of nets found.
