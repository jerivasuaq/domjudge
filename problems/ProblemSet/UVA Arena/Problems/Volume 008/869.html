<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; An airline catalog
consists of a list of flights between pairs of cities. A trip may be built by
sequencing flights. Two airline companies are equivalent if they offer
connections between the same pairs of cities, irrespective of the number of
scales in between.</p>

<b><font size="3"><a name="problem">Problem</a></font></b></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Given the catalogs of
two airline companies, determine if they are equivalent or not.</p>

<b><font size="3"><a name="input">Input</a></font></b><p>
<b>
The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating
the number of the cases following, each of them as described below.
This line is followed by a blank line, and there is also a blank line between
two consecutive inputs.
</b>
<p>
<p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The input contains:
<ul>
	<li> First line: the number <b>N</b> of flights in the catalog of the first company;
	<li> N subsequent lines: two characters separated by one space, for the names of the
	     origin and destination cities of a flight;
	<li> Line N+2: the number <b>M</b> of flights in the catalog of the second company;
	<li> M subsequent lines: two characters separated by
         one space, for the names of the origin and destination cities of a flight.
</li></li></li></li></ul>

For each test case, the output must follow the description below.
The outputs of two consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.
