<p align="left">Morse code has been used for a long time in
telecommunications. Its external representation consists of
sequences of two distinct <em>atomic symbols</em>: the ``dot'' (a
short tone) and the ``dash'' (a slightly longer tone). A sequence
of dots and dashes forms a <em>symbol</em>.</p>

<p align="left">The exact representation associated with each
symbol was constructed after a statistical analysis of the
occurrence of the various letters in English text, so as to give
to the most frequent letters the shortest representation. For
instance, the letter <tt>E</tt> is represented as a single <em>dot</em>
while the letter <tt>T</tt> is a single <em>dash</em>. In regular
morse code, symbols are separated by a small pause (the <em>space</em>
atomic symbol).</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<h2><font color="#0000FF">Problem</font></h2>

<p>The technology you are employing does not allow for spaces to
separate symbols, so different arrangements have to be made:
you'll have to make do with a <em>Worse Code</em>, in which there
may be only two distinct symbols (the <em>dot</em> and the <em>dash</em>).</p>

<p>You are asked to write a program that evaluates the resourses
necessary to transmit a particular sentence in Worse Code. In
order to do that, your program has to be able to produce the
optimal Worse code, tailored for the input sentence.</p>

<p>The problem can be formulated as follows: </p>

<ul>
    <li>With just an input sentence, to (internally) determine an
        optimal Worse Code for that sentence and display the
        length (in number of ``dash-dot'' atomic symbols) of the
        resulting coded message. </li>
</ul>

<p><font color="#0000FF"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><font color="#0000FF">Input</font></h2>

<p>Several input sentences, each sentence in one or more lines and terminated with a
blank line or the end-of-file character.</p>

<p>Notes: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Sequences of whitespace and newlines within a sentence are to be converted
        into a single space character, except if they are at the
        end of the sentence, in which case they are ignored.</li>
    <li>Lower case letters are mapped to the corresponding upper
        case equivalents. Any other characters, including
        accented letters, are simply ignored.</li>
</ul>

<h2><font color="#0000FF">Output</font></h2>

<p>The number of atomic symbols (dot or dash) in the optimal
Worse Code representation for each input sentence on a line by itself.</p>

<p> </p>
