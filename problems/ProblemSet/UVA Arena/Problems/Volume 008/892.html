<p>
A common problem when processing incoming text is to isolate the words in the text.  This is made more
difficult by the punctuation; words have commas, ``quote marks", (even brackets) next to them, or hy-phens
in the middle of the word.  This punctuation doesn't count as letters when the words have to be looked up
in a dictionary by the program.

<p>

<p>
<br>
For this problem, you must separate out ``clean" words from text, that is, words with no attached or embedded
non-letters.  A ``word" is any continuous string of non-whitespace characters, with whitespace characters on
each side of it.  For this problem, a ``whitespace" character is a space character or an end-of-line character,
or the start or end of the file (so that, for example, if the input file consists of `<tt>Anne Bob</tt>', where there is a
space character between the A and B but no other, then there are two words, `<tt>Anne</tt>' and `<tt>Bob</tt>').

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
Input will consist of lines with no more
than 60 characters in each line.  Every line will be terminated by a character which isn't whitespace (which
will be followed immediately by an end-of-line character).  The input will be terminated by a line consisting
of a single `<tt>#</tt>'.

<p>

<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">
Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
Output must be the lines of the incoming text, with
the non-letters stripped away from each word.  A non-letter is any character which is not a letter (a - z and A - Z)
and not a whitespace character.  Your program must not change the letters and space characters.  When a non-letter occurs in the middle of a
word (ie there is no whitespace character next to it), it must be simply removed (see what happens to the
word `<tt>doesn't</tt>' in the example).  A word which consists entirely of non-letters will therefore be removed entirely.

<p>

<p>
<br>
There is a special rule for a hyphen (`<tt>-</tt>') when it is the very last character in a line:

<ul>
<li>the word part before the hyphen and the first word part on the next line form a single word;
</li>
<li>this complete word must be written on a line by itself;
</li>
<li>you can assume that there will always be a space before the word part on the first line, and a space after
the word part on the second line. These 2 spaces must appear in the output.
</li>
</ul>
