Deciphering Messages</a>&nbsp;</font></b></td></tr></table></center>
</h1>
The plaintext messages are written in the standard 26-letter
English alphabet, A-Z. The encryption is done with the
help of a cipher key. This cipher key is composed of an ordered
set <span class="MATH"><i>L</i></span> of English alphabet letters, which is called the
alphabetical key, and an integer <span class="MATH"><i>N</i></span> in the interval [1..25],
which is called the numerical key. Each word of <span class="MATH"><i>k</i></span> characters
is encrypted into a word of length between <span class="MATH"><i>k</i></span> and <span class="MATH"><i>k</i>*3</span> characters.
The encryption rules are as follows:

<p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Rule 1:</strong></dt>
<dd>Each word is encrypted separately; the space between
words is preserved. Each word is encrypted from the
leftmost to the rightmost letters.
</dd>
<dt><strong>Rule 2:</strong></dt>
<dd>A plaintext message letter <span class="MATH"><i>p</i></span> that does not belong to <span class="MATH"><i>L</i></span>
is enciphered as a ciphertext letter 
<span class="MATH"><i>c</i> = <i>ciph</i>(<i>p</i>)</span> where
<span class="MATH"><i>ciph</i></span> is a function defined below.
</dd>
<dt><strong>Rule 3:</strong></dt>
<dd>A plaintext message letter p that belongs to L is
enciphered as a string of three letters: the <span class="MATH"><i>m</i></span>-th letter of <span class="MATH"><i>L</i></span>,
followed by a ciphertext letter 
<span class="MATH"><i>c</i> = <i>ciph</i>(<i>p</i>)</span>, followed by the
<span class="MATH">(<i>m</i> + 1)</span>-th letter of <span class="MATH"><i>L</i></span>. The value of <span class="MATH"><i>m</i></span> is incremented
by one each time this rule is applied. Arithmetic is performed
as if <span class="MATH"><i>L</i></span> were circular.
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
For each plaintext message the initial value for <span class="MATH"><i>m</i></span> is one.

<p>
The function <span class="MATH"><i>ciph</i></span> translates each letter to the letter <span class="MATH"><i>N</i></span> letters
after it in the alphabet and arithmetic is performed as if
the alphabet were circular (for example, if <span class="MATH"><i>N</i></span> is 2,
then 
<span class="MATH"><i>ciph</i>(<i>A</i>) = <i>C</i>, <i>ciph</i>(<i>B</i>) = <i>D</i>,..., <i>ciph</i>(<i>X</i>) = <i>Z</i>;<i>ciph</i>(<i>Y</i>) = <i>A</i>;<i>ciph</i>(<i>Z</i>) = <i>B</i></span>).

<p>

<p>
<br>

<b>NOTE:</b> The keys used in the processes of ciphering and deciphering
are such that the ciphered text can always be
uniquely deciphered (that is, the keys do not contain images of
function <span class="MATH"><i>ciph</i></span> for none of its elements).

<p>

<p>
<br>
Your task is to write a program to decode messages encripted by
using the method just described.

<p>

<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">
Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
<b>The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating
the number of the cases following, each of them as described below.
This line is followed by a blank line, and there is also a blank line between
two consecutive inputs.
</b>

<p>

<p><p>
<br>

<p>
Input data file contains the alphabetical key in the first line,
the numerical key in the second line, the number of
messages that are to be deciphered in the third line, and a ciphered
text message in each of the remaining lines.
These text messages only contain uppercase letters in the standard 26-letter
English alphabet and, if it is the case,
also a space between words. These text messages supposedly result
from the encryption of several original plaintext
messages using the method described above with the cipher key given
in the first and second lines of the input file.

<p>

Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
<b>For each test case, the output must follow the description below.
The outputs of two consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.
</b>

<p>

<p><p>
<br>
For each of the input ciphered text messages, output of the original
plaintext message is required or an error message
(`<tt>error in encryption</tt>') in case the input text is not a correct
encryption of any plaintext message. The order
of the messages must be preserved.
