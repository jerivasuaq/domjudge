Nowadays mark-up languages like <tt>LaTeX</tt>, <tt>HTML</tt>, <tt>SGML</tt>, and <tt>XML</tt> are widely
used to define, in a completely textual
mode, the structure of documents. Those languages are composed by tags,
or annotations, that are used to mark blocks
of text (their begin and end) in order:

<p>

<ul>
<li>to specify the document structure - for instance, the <em>front material</em>
 like the <em>title</em>, the <em>authors</em>, the <em>date</em>, or a <em>chapter</em>,
with its <em>sections</em> and <em>paragraphs</em>;
</li>
<li>to give them some special interpretation, or a particular formatting
 information - for instance, to say that the
block designates a <em>country</em>, a <em>profession</em>, a <em>king</em>, or the block must
be printed out in <em>italic</em>, or <em>boldface</em>.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Tags are just words like all the others that belong to the original
plain text; so, it is necessary to use some lexical
convention to distinguish those special words (annotations). Also,
we need some convention to identify the beginning
and the end of the text block we want to annotate.

<p>
In the present
context, our mark-up language follows an approach
similar to the <tt>SGML</tt> based languages:

<p>

<ul>
<li>special characters - square <code>[ ]</code> and curly  <code>{ }</code>
brackets - are used to identify the words that are tag names;
</li>
<li>the same tag name is used to setup block boundaries, and a lexical
 detail defines the opening and closing tag.
The convention is:
<code>[opening-tag[</code>, <code>]closing-tag]</code> and <code>{opening-closing-tag}</code>.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Paired tags are employed to define the document structure, while single
tags are used to give meaning or formatting
information. Tag names (one letter followed by zero or more letters or
digits) are free, i.e. not previously defined;
this means that the user of that mark-up language can choose the names
of the tags he will employ to annotate his
document. However, to be a <b>valid annotation</b> it must be in conformity
with the following rules:

<p>

<ul>
<li>an <em>opening-tag</em> must always have a corresponding <em>closing-tag</em>;
</li>
<li>a <em>closing-tag</em> must always have a corresponding <em>opening-tag</em>;
</li>
<li>paired tags may be nested to any level, however the last opening-tag
 must be closed before any enclosing tag,
i.e. one external block can not be closed before an internal one;
</li>
<li>an <em>opening-closing-tag</em> can not have other tags inside; in that case,
 the corresponding block of text will appear
inside the curly brackets.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Given a structured document, supposed to be annotated accordingly to
the mark-up language above described, write
a program that validates it, that is that verifies if the tags are
properly used. If the document is valid (has no errors),
your program must identify all the different tag names used, separating
structural and semantic ones.

<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">
Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
<b>The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating
the number of the cases following, each of them as described below.
This line is followed by a blank line, and there is also a blank line between
two consecutive inputs.
</b>

<p>

<p><p>
<br>

<p>
The input is a plain text file with tags, following the above stated
conventions. Assume that lexical conventions
specified for the three tag types (<code>[opening-tag[</code>, <code>]closing-tag]</code> and
<code>{opening-closing-tag}</code>) are always complied.

<p>

<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">
Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
<b>For each test case, the output must follow the description below.
The outputs of two consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.
</b>

<p>

<p><p>
<br>
The output consists of:

<p>

<ul>
<li>just 1 line with the word `<tt>ERROR</tt>' if one of the rules above is not
 observed, making the input an invalid annotated document;
</li>
<li>2 lists with the tag names found, without duplicates and in the order
 they appear in the document (from the beginning to the end), 1 word per line.
 The first list begins with the
heading line `<tt>STRUCTURAL TAGS</tt>', while
the second list will begin with the heading line `<tt>SEMANTIC TAGS</tt>.
Blank lines between those are not allowed.
</li>
</ul>
