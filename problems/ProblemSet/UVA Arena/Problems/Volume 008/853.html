<h1 align="center"><font color="#0000FF">DVD Subtitles</font></h1>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p>One of the great things about movies on DVD is that you can
choose the language for the subtitles, in case you need them.</p>

<p>Let us consider that in the DVD the subtitles for a given
language come in a text file, one subtitle in each line. By
&quot;one subtitle&quot; we mean the short phrase that we see on
the screen at any given time, even if that phrase uses more than
one line on the screen. The subtitle files for all the available
languages have the same number of lines, although some lines can
be empty, for lack of an appropriate translation. There will be
an extra file indicating the exact times in which each subtitle
should be displayed on the screen, but we shall ignore it in this
problem.</p>

<p>Today, we want to explore the subtitle files in order to
automatically construct simple bilingual dictionaries. The idea
is quite simple. Take, for example, Portuguese and English
subtitles. Suppose a given word <i>p</i> appears in the
Portuguese file in lines <i>x</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>x</i><sub>2</sub>,
&#133;, <i>x</i><sub><i>n</i></sub>, with <i>n</i> &gt;= 2. Now
suppose a word <i>e</i> appears in exactly the same lines in the
English file. Then we can safely assume <i>e</i> is a legitimate
translation of <i>p</i>, and vice-versa. Here is an example.
First, a text in Portuguese:</p>

<p><font size="3" face="Courier New">Por favor, mostre-me o seu
bilhete.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Courier New">Lamento, mas esqueci-me
dele.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Courier New">Esqueceu-se do bilhete? Voce
deve ser maluco.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Courier New">Eu nao sou maluco. A sua mae
e que e.</font></p>

<p>Note that we are not using diacritical marks in the Portuguese
text. Now, the equivalent text in English:</p>

<p><font size="3" face="Courier New">May I see your ticket,
please?</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Courier New">I am sorry, but I forgot it.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Courier New">So, you forgot the ticket?
You must be crazy.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Courier New">I am not crazy. Crazy is
your mother.</font></p>

<p>The words <font size="3" face="Courier New">bilhete</font> and
<font size="3" face="Courier New">ticket</font> appear in lines 1
and 3, in the Portuguese and English texts, respectively. We,
therefore, conclude that <font size="3" face="Courier New">bilhete</font>
is the Portuguese translation of <font size="3" face="Courier New">ticket</font>. Likewise for <font size="3" face="Courier New">maluco</font> and <font size="3" face="Courier New">crazy</font> in lines 3 and 4, even though <font size="3" face="Courier New">crazy</font> appears twice in line 4
and <font size="3" face="Courier New">maluco</font> only appears
once. The word <font size="3" face="Courier New">forgot</font>
appears in lines 2 and 3, but cannot be translated using this
method, as in the Portuguese text the corresponding words in
these lines, <font size="3" face="Courier New">esqueci-me</font>
and <font size="3" face="Courier New">esqueceu-se</font>, are
different. </p>

<p>More generally, we can <font size="3" face="Courier New">say</font>
that a word <i>w</i><sub>1</sub> in language <i>L</i><sub>1</sub>
translates to word <i>w</i><sub>2</sub> in language <i>L</i><sub>2</sub>
if the set of line numbers in which <i>w</i><sub>1</sub> occurs
is equal to the set of line numbers in which <i>w</i><sub>2</sub>
appears in their respective subtitle files. We consider only
words that occur at least twice, and words with at least three
characters. Note that several occurrences of the same word on a
given line are equivalent to a single occurrence.</p>

<p>There&#146;s an ambiguous case, however: two (or more) words
in the same language appearing on exactly the same lines in the
subtitle file. To remove this ambiguity, those words are to be
appended, separated by one space, in alphabetical order. See the
example below, in the input and output samples.</p>

<p>The result of processing is a sorted list of pairs of words,
as in a dictionary. The list is be sorted by the first word of
each pair and all words are in lowercase only.</p>

<h2><font color="#0000FF"><b>Problem</b></font></h2>

<p>Your task is to write a program that given two subtitle files
constructs a bilingual dictionary as explained above. To avoid
difficult cases caused by small words, your program should ignore
all input words with less than three characters.</p>

<h2><font color="#0000FF"><b>Input</b></font></h2>

<p>The first line of the input contains the number <i>T</i> of test cases,
followed by <i>T</i> input blocks.

<p>The first line of each input block contains the number of lines in
each language, 0 &lt; <i>N</i> &lt;= 1000. The following <i>N</i>
lines contain the subtitles in the first language. After that,
 <i>N</i> more lines contain the subtitles of the second language.</p>

<p>Each subtitle consists of normal ASCII text, using both
lowercase and uppercase, and punctuation, but no diacritical
marks (accents, cedillas or tildes). For the purposes of this
program, words contain letters and hyphens only, and processing
is case insensitive.</p>

<p>You can assume that the maximum number of words in each
subtitle line is 20; the maximum number of different words for
each language is 1000; and the maximum length of each word is 24.</p>

<h2><font color="#0000FF"><b>Output</b></font></h2>

<p>The output for each test case is a sorted list of lines,
each one containing two lowercase words separated by a slash.
The second word in each pair is the translation of the first one,
as discovered by the program. In some cases, there might be pairs
or triples, etc., of words, as a result of the ambiguity referred
above.</p>

<p>Separate the output of each test case with a single blank line.</p>
