<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; In a 2-D Cartesian space, a straight line segment A is defined
by two points <b>A<sub>0</sub>=(x<sub>0</sub>,y<sub>0</sub>)</b>, <b>A<sub>1</sub>=(x<sub>1</sub>,y<sub>1</sub>)</b>.
The intersection of line segments <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> (if there is one),
together with the initial four points, defines four new line segments.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
In Figure 1.1, the intersection <b>P</b> between lines <b>B</b> and <b>C</b>
defines four new segments. As a result, the toal amount of line segments after
the evaluation of intersections is five.</p>

<b><font size="3"><a name="problem">Problem</a></font></b></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Given an initial set of lines segments, determine the number of line segments resulting from the
evaluation of all the possible intersections.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; It is assumed, as
a simplification, that no coincidences may occur between coordinates of singular
points (intersections or end points).</p>

<b><font size="3"><a name="input">Input</a></font></b><p>
<b>
The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating
the number of the cases following, each of them as described below.
This line is followed by a blank line, and there is also a blank line between
two consecutive inputs.
</b>
<p>
<p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The first line of the input contains the integer number <b>N</b>
of line segments. Each of the following N lines contains four integer values <b>x<sub>0</sub>
y<sub>0</sub> x<sub>1</sub> y<sub>1</sub></b>,separated by a single space, that define a line segment.</p>

<b><font size="3"><a name="output">Output</a></font></b></p>
<b>
For each test case, the output must follow the description below.
The outputs of two consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.
</b>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The integer number of lines segments after all the possible
intersections are evaluated.</p>
