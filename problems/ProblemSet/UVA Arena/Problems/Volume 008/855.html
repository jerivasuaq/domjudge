<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="justify">
Grid city is a city carefully planned. Its street-map very much
resembles that of downtown Manhattan in New York. Streets and avenues
are orderly setup like a grid.

<p align="justify">
A group of friends living in Grid city decide to meet for lunch. Given
that the group is dynamic, that is, its size may grow or shrink from time to
time, they follow a written rule to determine the meeting point. It
states that the meeting point is the one that minimizes the total
distance the all group has to walk from their homes upto that point.
If there is more than one candidate point, the rule imposes that the
meeting point is the one corresponding to the smaller number for
street and avenue. For large groups, this rule naturally avoids the
usual long discussions that take place before aggreeing on a possible
meeting point. For simplicity, consider that each person lives at a
corner formed by a street and an avenue. You can also assume that the
distance between two corners along one street or avenue is always one
unit.

<p align="justify">
Your task is to suggest to the group their best meeting point (corner
between a street and an avenue). 

<p align="justify">
As an example, the following figure illustrates one such Crid city and
the location of 11 friends. For this scenario, the best meeting point
is street 3 and avenue 4. You can assume that streets and avenues are
set and ordered as illustrated in this figure.

<p align="center"><img src="p855.jpg"></p>

<p align="justify">
Please note that if we add another friend located at, say street 3 and
avenue 5, making a total of 12 friends, then we would have two
candidate meeting points, pairs (3,4) and (3,5). The rule clearly
defines that street 3 and avenue 4 is the meeting point.


<h2><font color="#0000FF"><b>Problem</b></font></h2>

<p align="justify">
Given the size of a grid representing the Grid city and the locations
of each person of the group of friends, your task is to determine the
best meeting point following the rule of the group, as stated above.

<h2><font color="#0000FF"><b>Input</b></font></h2>

<p align="justify">The first line of the input contains the number
<i>T</i> of test cases, followed by <i>T</i> input blocks.

<p align="justify">
The first line of each test case consists of three positive numbers, the number
of streets <i>S</i>, the number of avenues <i>A</i> (where <i>S <=></=></i> and <i>A <=></=></i>), and the number of friends <i>F</i> (where
<i>0 < f=""><=></=></i>). The following <i>F</i> input lines indicate the
locations of the friends. A location is defined by two numbers, a
street and an avenue, in this order.

<h2><font color="#0000FF"><b>Output</b></font></h2>

<p align="justify">
The output for each test case must list the best meeting point
formatted as follows:
<tt>(Street: 3, Avenue: 4)</tt>.

<p align="justify">
Each test case must be on a separate line.
