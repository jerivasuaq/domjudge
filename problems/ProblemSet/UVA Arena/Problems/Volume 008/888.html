Long ago, a number of farmers wanted to sell their donkeys. These farmers lived in a small
village and the marketplace was in the capital. There was only one small road from the village
the farmers lived in to the capital, and one day the farmers left for the long journey towards the
capital. Every farmer wanted to travel as fast as possible to be the first to sell his donkey, but
there was one major problem: the donkeys were very stubborn; everytime a donkey reached a
river there was a chance that he would stay there for some time, not willing to cross the river.
However, two donkeys never rested at the same river.

<p>

<p>
<br>
The game 'Donkey' is derived from this legend: <span class="MATH"><i>N</i></span> players (numbered from <span class="MATH">1...<i>N</i></span>) start with
their donkey in the village. Between the village and the capital are <span class="MATH"><i>M</i></span> rivers. The players take
turns in throwing a fair, 6-sided die and move their donkey the thrown number of rivers towards
the capital. Since only one donkey can rest at a river, the donkey is placed at the next free river
if necessary. After player 1 has thrown the die, it is player 2's turn, etc. After <span class="MATH"><i>N</i></span> comes 1. The
player that passes all rivers first wins the game.

<p>
This is an example of a 'Donkey' gameboard, where <span class="MATH"><i>N</i> = 2</span> and <span class="MATH"><i>M</i> = 6</span>. Player 1's donkey is
located at river 4 and player 2's donkey is located at river 1.

Your task is to give the probability that player 1 wins the game, given a certain board position.

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>
The first line contains a single integer which equals the number of test cases that follow. Each of
the following lines contains one test case. The first integer on a line gives the number of rivers
<span class="MATH"><i>M</i></span>, the second integer gives the number of players <span class="MATH"><i>N</i></span> (
<span class="MATH">1<img width="18" height="30" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="888img2.png" alt="$ \le$"><i>N</i><img width="18" height="30" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="888img2.png" alt="$ \le$">4</span> and 
<span class="MATH"><i>N</i>&#215;<i>M</i><img width="18" height="30" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="888img2.png" alt="$ \le$">50</span>). Then follow
<span class="MATH"><i>N</i></span> integers <span class="MATH"><i>P</i><sub>i</sub></span> (
<span class="MATH">0<img width="18" height="30" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="888img2.png" alt="$ \le$"><i>P</i><sub>i</sub><img width="18" height="30" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="888img2.png" alt="$ \le$"><i>M</i></span>, 
<span class="MATH">1<img width="18" height="30" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="888img2.png" alt="$ \le$"><i>i</i><img width="18" height="30" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="888img2.png" alt="$ \le$"><i>N</i></span>), representing the position of the <span class="MATH"><i>i</i></span>-th player. The river
closest to the village has number 1, the river closest to the capital has number <span class="MATH"><i>M</i></span>. The village
has number 0. Two donkeys may not be positioned at the same river. However, more than one
donkey may be standing in the village. The last integer on the line gives the player, whose turn
it is.

<p>
For every situation you have to print the following line, giving the game number (1 for the first,
2 for the second, ...) and the probability player 1 wins with an accuracy of 3 decimals:

<p>

<p>
<br>

<tt>Game <span class="MATH"><i>N</i></span>:the probability that player 1 wins = <span class="MATH"><i>D</i>.<i>DDD</i></span></tt>
