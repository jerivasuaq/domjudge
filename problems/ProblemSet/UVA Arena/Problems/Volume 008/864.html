<p>
Scheme is an expression language.  This means that everything that is
entered to the Scheme interpreter/compiler is an expression.
Expressions are separated by blank space (blank, tabs, new-lines).
Expressions can be in several forms:

<p>

<ol>
<li>numbers - a sequence of digits, possibly preceded by a `<tt>+</tt>'
or `<tt>-</tt>', possibly including a single `<tt>.</tt>' following at least
one digit
</li>
<li>strings - a sequence of characters (not including newlines)
preceded and followed by `<tt>"</tt>', with any included double-quote
characters preceded by a `<code>\</code>', such as
<code>"This `\"' is a double-quote"</code>
</li>
<li>special constants - a `<code>#</code>' followed by any characters up to
blank space
</li>
<li>compound expressions - a (possibly empty) sequence of
expressions surrounded by parentheses
</li>
<li>identifiers - a sequence of non-blank characters not including
the characters: <code>#</code>, <code>"</code>, <code>\</code>, <code>(</code>, and <code>)</code>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
A sequence of Scheme expressions.

<p>

<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">
Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>
The same sequence of expressions, reformatted to make them more
readable.  The rules you must follow are:

<p>

<ol>
<li>All top level expressions will start with no leading blanks on a line.
</li>
<li>A compound expression with the first sub-expression being the
identifier <code>`define</code>' is a define-form. The second sub-expression
will be an identifier and should go on the same line as the word
<code>`define</code>'. If the third (and last) expression is compound it
should start on the following line, indented 3 spaces.  Otherwise, the
whole define-form should be on a single line.
</li>
<li>A compound expressions with the first sub-expression being the
identifier <code>`lambda</code>' is a lambda-form. The second sub-expression
will be an identifier or compound expression and should go on the same line as the word
<code>`lambda</code>'. All subsequent expressions should start on a new line,
indented by an additional 3 spaces
</li>
<li>A compound expressions with the first sub-expression being the
identifier <code>`if</code>' is an if-form. The second sub-expression
will be an identifier or compound expression and should go on the same line as the word
<code>`if</code>'. All subsequent expressions should start on a new line,
indented by an additional 4 spaces
</li>
<li>All other compound expressions are function applications.  If
any of the sub-expressions are compound, the first two sub-expressions
will be on the same line and all subsequent sub-expressions will be on
new lines, indented to align with the second sub-expression.
</li>
<li>In all other cases, all blank space between elements of a
compound expression will be replaced by a single space.
</li>
</ol>
