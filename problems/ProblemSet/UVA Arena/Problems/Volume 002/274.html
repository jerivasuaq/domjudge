<p>
In a house with many rooms live a cat and a mouse. The cat and the mouse
each have chosen one room as their ``home&quot;. From their ``home&quot;
they regularly walk through the house. A cat can go from room A to room
B if and only if there is a cat door from room A to room B. Cat doors can
only be used in one direction. Similarly a mouse can go from room A to room
B if and only if there is a mouse door from room A to room B . Also mouse
doors can be used in only one direction. Furthermore, cat doors cannot be
used by a mouse, and mouse doors cannot be used by a cat.
<p>
Given a map of the house you are asked to write a program that finds out
<p>
<ol><li> if there exist walks for the cat and mouse where they meet each other
in some room, and<li> if the mouse can make a walk through at least two rooms, end in its
``home&quot; room again, and along the way cannot ever meet the cat.
(Here, the mouse may not ever meet the cat, whatever the cat does.) 
</li></li></ol>

<p>
For example, in the map, the cat can meet the mouse in rooms 1, 2, and 3.
Also, the mouse can make a walk through two rooms without ever meeting the
cat, viz., a round trip from room 5 to 4 and back.

<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</a></font></h2>
<p>
<b>
The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating 
the number of the cases following, each of them as described below. 
This line is followed by a blank line, and there is also a blank line between 
two consecutive inputs.
</b>
<p>
<p>
The input consists of integers and defines the configuration of the house.
The first line has three integers separated by blanks: the first integer
defines the number of rooms, the second the initial room of the cat (the
cat's ``home&quot;), and the third integer defines the initial room
of the mouse (the mouse's ``home&quot;). Next there are zero or more
lines, each with two positive integers separated by a blank. These lines
are followed by a line with two <tt>-1</tt>'s separated by a blank. The pairs of
positive integers define the cat doors. The pair A B represents the presence
of a cat door from room A to room B . Finally there are zero or more lines,
each with two positive integers separated by a blank. These pairs of integers
define the mouse doors. Here, the pair A B represents the presence of a
mouse door from room A to room B .
<p>
<p>
The number of rooms is at least one and at most 100. All rooms are numbered
consecutively starting at 1. You may assume that all positive integers in
the input are legal room numbers.
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</a></font></h2>
<p>
<b>
For each test case, the output must follow the description below. 
The outputs of two consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.
</b>
<p>
<p>
The output consists of two characters separated by a blank and ended by
a new-line character. The first character is <tt>Y</tt> if there exist walks for
the cat and mouse where they meet each other in some room. Otherwise, it
is <tt>N</tt>. The second character is <tt>Y</tt> if the mouse can make a walk through at
least two rooms, end in its ``home&quot; room again, and along the way
cannot ever meet the cat. Otherwise, it is <tt>N</tt>.
