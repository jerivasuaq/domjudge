TeX is a typesetting language developed by Donald Knuth. It takes source
text together with a few typesetting instructions and produces, one hopes,
a beautiful document. Beautiful documents use `` and &quot;
to delimit quotations, rather than the mundane <tt>&quot;</tt> which is what is provided
by most keyboards. Keyboards typically do not have an oriented double-quote,
but they do have a left-single-quote <tt>`</tt> and a right-single-quote <tt>'</tt>. Check
your keyboard now to locate the left-single-quote key <tt>`</tt> (sometimes called
the ``backquote key&quot;) and the right-single-quote key <tt>'</tt> (sometimes
called the ``apostrophe&quot; or just ``quote&quot;). Be careful
not to confuse the left-single-quote <tt>`</tt> with the ``backslash&quot; key
<code>\</code>. TeX lets the user type two left-single-quotes <tt>``</tt> to create a left-double-quote ``
and two right-single-quotes <tt>''</tt> to create a right-double-quote ''. Most typists,
however, are accustomed to delimiting their quotations with the un-oriented
double-quote <tt>&quot;</tt>.
<p>
<p>
If the source contained
<p>
<tt>&quot;To be or not to be,&quot; quoth the bard, &quot;that is the question.&quot;</tt>
<p>
then the typeset document produced by TeX would not contain the desired
form:
<p>
<p>
<p>
``To be or not to be,&quot; quoth the bard, ``that is the question.&quot;
<p>
<p>
In order to produce the desired form, the source file must
contain the sequence:
<p>
<tt>``To be or not to be,'' quoth the bard, ``that is the question.''</tt>
<p>
<p>
You are to write a program which converts text containing double-quote (<tt>&quot;</tt>)
characters into text that is identical except that double-quotes have been
replaced by the two-character sequences required by TeX for delimiting quotations
with oriented double-quotes. The double-quote (<tt>&quot;</tt>) characters should
be replaced appropriately by either <tt>``</tt> if the <tt>&quot;</tt> opens a quotation and
by <tt>''</tt> if the <tt>&quot;</tt> closes a quotation. Notice that the question of nested
quotations does not arise: The first <tt>&quot;</tt> must be replaced by <tt>``</tt>, the
next by <tt>''</tt>, the next by <tt>``</tt>, the next by <tt>''</tt>, the next by <tt>``</tt>, the next by <tt>''</tt>, and so on.

<p>
Input will consist of several lines of text containing an even number of
double-quote (<tt>&quot;</tt>) characters. Input is ended with an end-of-file character.
The text must be output exactly as it was input except that:
<p>
<ul><li> the first <tt>&quot;</tt> in each pair is replaced by two <tt>`</tt> characters: <tt>``</tt> and<li> the second <tt>&quot;</tt> in each pair is replaced by two <tt>'</tt> characters: <tt>''</tt>.
</li></li></ul><h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Sample Input</a></font></h2>
<p>
<pre>&quot;To be or not to be,&quot; quoth the Bard, &quot;that
is the question&quot;.
The programming contestant replied: &quot;I must disagree.
To `C' or not to `C', that is The Question!&quot;</pre>
