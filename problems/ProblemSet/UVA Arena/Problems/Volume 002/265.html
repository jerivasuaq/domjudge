<p>
You have been hired to arrange the seating of diplomats at a dinner party.
Your employer has invited 9 diplomats from several countries around the
world. Each diplomat will speak from one to five languages. Diplomats not
speaking a common language can not talk to each other. Furthermore, some
of the countries represented will not have diplomatic relations with other
nations represented, so these diplomats will not be speaking to each other
either. Your task is to determine the seating arrangement at the dinner
table for your employer and the 9 guests such that each person can speak
to the person seated on each side.
<p>
The table to be used for dinner is round, and seats 10 people. Your employer
will be seated at the first position at the table. The other positions will
be numbered clockwise from 2 to 10. The person seated to the left of your
employer is in seat number 2, the person seated to the right of your employer
is in seat number 10.
<p>
Persons seated next to each other must speak a common language. A person
may speak to the person on the left in one common language, and speak to
the person on the right in another language. The governments of the guests
seated next to each other must have formally recognized each other.
<p>
The government of your employer has diplomatic relations with the governments
of all of his guests. The government of a guest may or may not have diplomatic
relations with the governments of all the other guests.
<p>
Two diplomats from the same country will have diplomatic relations with
the same list of countries. A country will always have diplomatic relations
with itself. Diplomats from the same country may or may not speak any languages
in common.

<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</a></font></h2>
<p>
Input to the program will contain several data sets. Each data set will be a list of ten people, one per line, ended by
a blank line. The first line will represent your employer, the other lines
will represent the guest diplomats. Each line consists of a sequence of
words, where words are separated by a single space. Each word is a sequence
of capitals. The first word consists of 3 characters and represents the
code for the guest's country. The second word contains 1 to 5 characters
and represents the languages that the guest speaks. Each language that the
guest speaks is represented by a single letter. Finally, there is a list
of up to 9 three-character words representing the codes of the countries
of the other guests that this guest's government has diplomatic relations
with.
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</a></font></h2>
<p>
Output of each data set is a table of the seating arrangement. It contains
one diplomat per line. Each line starts with the seat number followed by
three words, all separated by single spaces. The first word is the language
code for the person seated on the left. The second word is the country code
for the diplomat. The third word is the language code for the person seated
on the right. The seating arrangement should be printed in the order 1 to
10, and no blank line should appear after line 10. More than one solution
may exist, but you need find only one. If no solution is found, output the
sentence
<p>
<pre>NO SOLUTION EXISTS</pre>
<p>
Print a blank line after each data set.
