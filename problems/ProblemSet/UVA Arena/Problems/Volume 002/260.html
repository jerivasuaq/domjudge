The game `Il Gioco dell' X' is played
on a <i>N</i> by <i>N</i> board ( <img width="46" height="26" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline133" src="260img1.gif"> ).  The object of both
players, say Black and White, is to join
opposite sides of the board by placing in turn their
pawns on the board in such a way that a
path is made from one side to the other by adjacent
(neighboring) pawns of their own color.
Although the board is  <img width="52" height="24" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline135" src="260img2.gif">  it is not a square
but rather diamond-shaped.  Let us denote
the field on the board in row <i>i</i> and column <i>j</i> by
 <img width="138" height="27" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline141" src="260img3.gif"> .  The neighbors of (<i>i</i>, <i>j</i>) are:
<p>
<pre>                       ( i-1 , j-1 ) , ( i-1 ,  j  ) 
                       (  i  , j-1 ) , (  i  , j+1 ) 
                       ( i+1 ,  j  ) , ( i+l , j+1 )</pre>
<p>
provided these fields do not fall outside the board.
<p>
Black tries to join row 1 with row <i>N</i>, while White
tries to join column 1 with column <i>N</i>.

lt is a Deep Mathematical Result that this
game cannot end in a draw (that is, without
winner).  As we will present to you only
full boards, there will always be a winner.  It may,
however, be difficult to see who has won,
so some computer assistance would be appreciated.

<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Input</a></font></h2>
<p>
The input is a textfile containing a
number of games.  Each game is given by: one line
containing an integer <i>N</i>, being the number
of rows. (<i>N</i> can he any number between 2 and
200).  This line is followed by <i>N</i> lines,
each consisting of a row of <i>N</i> characters from the set
{`<tt>b</tt>',`<tt>w</tt>'} denoting the pawns of Black
and White respectively.  The numbers of black and white
pawns will differ by at most one.  Note that
all positions on the board are filled with pawns.
The list of games ends with a single zero
on a line of its own. (Of course, this is not a game
for which a winner has to be determined.)

<p>
The output will be a textfile containing
one line for each game.  This line should contain
the number of the game (starting at 1)
followed by a space, and followed by an uppercase `<tt>B</tt>'
if Black did win, or followed by an uppercase `<tt>W</tt>' if White did win.
