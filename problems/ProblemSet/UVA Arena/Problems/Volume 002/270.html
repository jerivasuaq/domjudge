<p>``How am I ever going to solve this problem?" said the pilot. 
<p>
<p>Indeed, the pilot was not facing an easy task. She had to drop packages at 
specific points scattered in a dangerous area. Furthermore, the pilot could only 
fly over the area once in a straight line, and she had to fly over as many 
points as possible. All points were given by means of integer coordinates in a 
two-dimensional space. The pilot wanted to know the largest number of points 
from the given set that all lie on one line. Can you write a program that 
calculates this number? 
<p>
<p>Your program has to be efficient!

<h2><font color="#0070e8"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</a></font></h2>
<p>The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself 
indicating the number of the cases following, each of them as described below. 
This line is followed by a blank line, and there is also a blank line between 
two consecutive inputs.<br>The input consists of <i>N</i> pairs of integers, 
where 1 &lt; <i>N</i> &lt; 700. Each pair of integers is separated by one blank 
and ended by a new-line character. The list of pairs is ended with an 
end-of-file character. No pair will occur twice.

<p>For each test case, the output must follow the description below. The outputs 
of two consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line. <br>The output 
consists of one integer representing the largest number of points that all lie 
on one line.
