<p>
Write a program that will compare two texts. The two texts are assumed do be
different versions of the same text. Three different things can happen to a text between two versions:
<p>
<ul><li> Text could be deleted<li> Text could be inserted<li> Text could be changed
</li></li></li></ul>
<p>
Any combination of the three can occur at once. A move, for example will look as a deletion at one place and an insert at another. You should
list all changes that happened from the old to the new version.
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</a></font></h2>
<p>
The input file contains several datasets, each containing two lines with <tt>text1</tt> and <tt>text2</tt> strings.
They contain the two versions of
the text to compare. String <tt>text2</tt> should be regarded as the older version, and string <tt>text1</tt> as the newer.
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</a></font></h2>
<p>
The outputfile contain all deletions, insertions
and changes that happended to the text between the two versions
in the following format:
<p>
<ul><li> deletion: Position of the first character deleted,
the word ``<tt>deleted</tt>'' and the number
of characters deleted and the text that has been deleted.<li> insertion: Position of the first character of the text inserted,
the word ``<tt>inserted</tt>''
since the last version, the number of characters inserted an the text inserted.<li> change: Position of the first character changed,
the word ``<tt>changed</tt>'', the number of
characters changed, the original text and what it has been changed to.
</li></li></li></ul>
<p>
The position of the first character always refers to the position in
the <i>older</i> version (i.e.
the position within <tt>text2</tt>). The first character in a file
is numbered zero (0). The
program should <i>not</i> be case-sensitive. Print a blank line after each dataset.
