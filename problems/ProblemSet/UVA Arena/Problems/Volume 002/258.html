<p>
In a galaxy far far away from our's, there
lived a team of scientists who invented a device
that could kill all computervirusses that do
terrible things to MS-DOS computers.  This device
could do its job in the entire universe
because it used a magic laser beam.  But, just like in all
great devices, this device had a strange
component in it.  This component is a two-dimensional
maze with black holes and mirrors in it.
Nobody knew the reason for this component but the
scientists said it was a crucial component.
<p>
<p>
This maze has two openings in it.
One of these openings is in front of the magic laser.  All
the mirrors in the maze have two reflecting sides.
These mirrors always make an angle of 45
degrees with the laser beam but they can be
rotated over 90 degrees, so each mirror can be
in 2 states only.  The laser beam will be
totally absorbed by a black hole. The laser beam may
cross itself (with an angle of 90 degrees) in an empty place of the maze.
<p>
<p>
In this problem you are given several
mazes (one at a time) in which you have to position
the mirrors in such a way that the
laser beam can travel from one entrance to the other.
The border of each maze is marked by
black holes (except for two places which are the two
entrances of the maze).  The mirrors in
the given mazes will probably not have a correct angle
to reflect a laser beam from one entrance
of the maze to the other.  The mirrors in the given
mazes can be positioned in such a way
that a laser beam can travel through the maze.
<p>
<p>
Your program must read the mazes from
the input file and position the mirrors in it in such
a way that a laser beam that enters
through one entrance exits through the other.

<p>
The input for your program is a textflle.
This file contains severas mazes.  A specification of a
single maze is given by the following description:
<p>
<ul><li> First a line that contains two positive
  integers (say <i>M</i> and <i>N</i>) separated by one space
  which specify the number of columns and
  the number of rows (in that order) of the maze
  to come.  These integers can have a value from 3 to 50 inclusive.<li> On the next <i>N</i> lines follows the maze
  with the mirrors and black holes.  Mirrors are given
  by a <code>\</code> (backslash) or a <tt>/</tt> (divide).
   Here <code>\</code> and <tt>/</tt> correspond to the 2 states of a mirror.
   Black holes are given by <tt>*</tt> (star).
   Empty places in the maze are given by dots.
</li></li></ul>
<p>
The last line of the input file is given by `<tt>-1 -1</tt>'.

<p>
The output file is a textfile which
contains the resulting mazes.  The mazes in the output
file must be separated from each other by one empty line.
