In your childhood you most likely had to solve the riddle of the house of Santa Claus. Do
you remember that the importance was on drawing the house in a stretch without lifting
the pencil and not drawing a line twice? As a reminder it has to
look like shown in Figure 1.
<p>
<p><a name="30">&#160;</a> <img width="161" height="180" align="BOTTOM" alt="figure20" src="291img1.gif"> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> The House of Santa Claus<br>
<p>
<p>
Well, a couple of years later, like now, you have to ``draw'' the
house again but on the
computer. As one possibility is not enough, we require <i>all</i> the
possibilities when starting
in the lower left corner. Follow the example in Figure 2 while defining
your stretch.
<p>
<p><a name="51">&#160;</a> <img width="158" height="179" align="BOTTOM" alt="figure33" src="291img2.gif"> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> This Sequence would give the Outputline 153125432<br>
<p>
<p>
All the possibilities have to be listed in the outputfile by increasing order, meaning that <tt>1234...</tt> is listed before <tt>1235...</tt> .
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Output</a></font></h2>
<p>
So, an outputfile could look like this:
<p>
<pre>12435123
13245123
...
15123421</pre>
<p>
</body>
