Mathematicians love all sorts of odd properties of numbers. For instance, they consider
945 to be an interesting number, since it is the first odd number for which the sum of its
divisors is larger than the number itself.
<p>
<p>
To help them search for interesting numbers, you are to write a program that scans a
range of numbers and determines the number that has the largest number of divisors in the
range. Unfortunately, the size of the numbers, and the size of the range is such that a too
simple-minded approach may take too much time to run. So make sure that your algorithm
is clever enough to cope with the largest possible range in just a few seconds.

<p>
The first line of input specifies the number <i>N</i> of ranges, and each of the <i>N</i> following lines
contains a range, consisting of a lower bound <i>L</i> and an upper bound <i>U</i>, where <i>L</i> and <i>U</i> are included in the range. <i>L</i> and <i>U</i> are chosen such
that  <img width="190" height="26" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline42" src="294img1.gif">  and  <img width="145" height="26" align="MIDDLE" alt="tex2html_wrap_inline44" src="294img2.gif"> .
<p>
<h2><font color="#0070E8"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output Specification</a></font></h2>
<p>
For each range, find the number <i>P</i> which has the largest number of divisors (if several numbers
tie for first place, select the lowest), and the number of positive divisors <i>D</i> of <i>P</i> (where
<i>P</i> is included as a divisor). Print the text <tt>'Between <i>L</i> and <i>H</i>, <i>P</i> has a maximum of <i>D</i>
divisors.'</tt>, where <i>L</i>, <i>H</i>, <i>P</i>, and <i>D</i> are the numbers as defined above.
