"The instructions to turn always to the left reminded me that
such was the common procedure for discovering the central courtyard
of certain labyrinths."

in <i>The garden of forking paths</i> by Jorge Luis Borges.


<p>
A fellow librarian has exhumed in the Library of Babel a vast catalogue
of labyrinths. It is our duty to classify them all and we count on
your assistance. The plans of the labyrinths are already digitized
and we need you to write a program to decide if the central courtyard
of a given labyrinth can be reached following the simple procedure
of always turning left at any intersection, and thus be called a <i>left
labyrinth</i>.

<p>
The digitalization process reduces the plan of a labyrinth to a grid
of cells, being each cell either a block of wall or just floor. Walls
are sequences of contiguous blocks, forming either horizontal or vertical
corridors between them. Each labyrinth has a single entrance, a hole
in its exterior walls, and a single central courtyard. The courtyard
differs from the corridors in the shape: a floor cell in a corridor has
at least 2 block of wall on each side. You can assume that each plan
has a single labyrinth and its outside walls can be contoured within
the plan.

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>
<b>
The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating
the number of the cases following, each of them as described below.
This line is followed by a blank line, and there is also a blank line between
two consecutive inputs.
</b>
<p>

The first two input lines are the integers, smaller than 100, 


<blockquote>
<p>
<it>n</it> - the number of lines in the map, and

<p>
<it>m</it> - the number of characters per line in the map.
</blockquote>

<p>
The following <it>n</it> lines, each with <it>m</it> characters, have
only two valid character values:

<blockquote>
<p>
<tt>#</tt> - (sharp) representing a block of a wall;

<p>
<tt>.</tt> - (dot) representing part of the floor.
</blockquote>

Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>
<b>
For each test case, the output must follow the description below.
The outputs of two consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.
</b>
<p>

Your program must write either <tt>YES</tt> if the given labyrinth
is a left labyrinth or <tt>NO</tt> otherwise
