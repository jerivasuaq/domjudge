<p>
In order to ensure that the contestants find it easy to reach the regional contest
site, the authority has prepared some robot-driven vehicles. The vehicles would
visit <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span> predetermined junctions and carry the contestants waiting there to the
contest. There is a computer controlled Transportation Center (TC) that determines
the number of seats of each vehicle and the time each vehicle leaves the contest
site for the first time.

<p>
When a new vehicle is needed, a request is made to the TC. Every new vehicle has
fewer number of seats than the last vehicle if it is more than 3: the <span class="MATH"><i>i</i></span>-th
vehicle has 
<span class="MATH">max(<i>s</i> - (<i>i</i> - 1)*<i>t</i>, 3)</span> seats (
<span class="MATH"><i>i</i> = 1, 2,...</span>). The first vehicle
leaves the contest site just at 8:00am. When TC gets a request for a new vehicle,
it prepares a new vehicle and right after 2 seconds of getting the request, the new
vehicle leaves the contest site. If multiple requests are made at the same time,
only one is considered.

<p>
At the junction <span class="MATH"><i>j</i></span>, each vehicle does the following tasks. If there are more than
one vehicle at <span class="MATH"><i>j</i></span> at the same time, they perform the tasks in order of their
service times: the one with the longest service time goes first. Service time of a
vehicle is the difference between current time and the time the vehicle left the
contest site (which is at junction 0) for the first time.

<p>

<ol>
<li>If <span class="MATH"><i>j</i> = 0</span> (the contest site), all the contestants in the vehicle gets
        down. Otherwise, the vehicle picks up as many contestants as it can (i.e. until
        the vehicle is full or there are no contestants left at junction <span class="MATH"><i>j</i></span>).
</li>
<li>If, after that, there are any contestant left at junction <span class="MATH"><i>j</i></span> (<span class="MATH"><i>j</i> &gt; 0</span>),
        the vehicle sends a request for a new vehicle to the TC.
</li>
<li>Finally the vehicle starts moving towards the next junction <span class="MATH"><i>k</i></span>, which
        is selected by the robot-driver in the following way (even at junction 0):
	
<ul>
<li>If the vehicle is full, <span class="MATH"><i>k</i> = 0</span>.
</li>
<li>Otherwise, if no other vehicle has left junction <span class="MATH"><i>j</i></span> yet,
                
<span class="MATH"><i>k</i> = (<i>j</i> + 1) mod <i>n</i></span>.
</li>
<li>Otherwise, <span class="MATH"><i>k</i></span> is (
<span class="MATH">(<i>k</i><sub>0</sub> + 1) mod <i>n</i></span>) if it is different from <span class="MATH"><i>j</i></span>.
</li>
<li>Otherwise, <span class="MATH"><i>k</i></span> is (
<span class="MATH">(<i>k</i><sub>0</sub> + 2) mod <i>n</i></span>). 
<br>
Here, <span class="MATH"><i>k</i><sub>0</sub></span> is the `<em>next junction</em>' selected by the last vehicle
                leaving junction <span class="MATH"><i>j</i></span>.
	
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Vehicles do the above 3 tasks instantly (i.e. in 0 seconds). Time needed to go from
each junction to any other junction is known. All the contestants reach a suitable
junction by 8:00am and don't go away until they are picked up by any vehicle.
Given the number of contestants waiting at each junction and a time limit, you are
to determine when everyone reaches the contest or how many have reached the contest
by the time limit.

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>
Input consists of several datasets. Each dataset consists of the followings:

<p>

<ul>
<li>A line containing the name of the set (which has 2 to 20 alphanumeric characters).
</li>
<li>A line containing 3 positive integers <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span>, <span class="MATH"><i>s</i></span> and <span class="MATH"><i>t</i></span> (
<span class="MATH">2 &lt; <i>n</i> &lt; 11</span>).
</li>
<li>Each of next <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span> lines contains <span class="MATH"><i>n</i> - 1</span> integers each. The <span class="MATH"><i>i</i></span>-th line
        (
<span class="MATH"><i>i</i> = 1, 2, 3...</span>) contains the time (in seconds) needed to go from the
        junction <span class="MATH"><i>i</i> - 1</span> to all other junctions (except the 
<span class="MATH">(<i>i</i> - 1)<sup>th</sup></span>) in order
        
<span class="MATH">0, 1, 2...<i>n</i></span>.
</li>
<li>Next <span class="MATH"><i>n</i> - 1</span> lines each contain a non-negative integer. The <span class="MATH"><i>i</i></span>-th line
        (
<span class="MATH"><i>i</i> = 1, 2, 3...</span>) contains the number of contestants waiting at the <span class="MATH"><i>i</i></span>-th junction.
</li>
<li>The last line of the dataset contains the time limit (in seconds, less
        than 10000000).
</li>
</ul>

<p>
All integers on a single line are separated by exactly one space. Total number of contestants
is at most 1000.

<p>
The end of input is marked with a line consisting of `<tt>TheEnd</tt>'.

Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>
For each set, print 2 lines. The first line contains the name of the set as it appears
in the input. The second line contains the time (in seconds) needed to bring all the
contestants to the contest, if the time is not more than the given time limit. Otherwise,
print the number of contestants reached the contest by the time limit.
