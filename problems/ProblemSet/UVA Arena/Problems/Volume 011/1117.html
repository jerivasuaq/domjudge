<p>
Consider a machine with <i><b>n</b></i> integer registers 
<i><b>r<sub>1</sub>, r<sub>2</sub>, ..., r<sub>n</sub></b></i>
and a single type of
<i>compare-exchange instruction</i>, CE (<i><b>i,j</b></i>) defined as follows, where

<i><b>1 &le; i &lt; j &le; n</b></i> are the register indices:
<br><br>
CE(<i><b>i,j</b></i>) : if content(<i><b>r<sub>i</sub></b></i>) &gt;
content(<i><b>r<sub>j</sub></b></i>)
then exchange the contents of registers <i><b>r<sub>i</sub></b></i> and <i><b>r<sub>j</sub></b></i>.
<br><br>

<p>
A compare-exchange program (shortly CE-program)
is any finite sequence of compare-exchange instructions.
A CE-program is called <i>minimum-finding</i> if
after its execution the register <i><b>r<sub>1</sub></b></i> always contains
the minimum value among all the initial values in the registers.
Furthermore, such program is  called <i>reliable</i> if it
remains a minimum-finding program after removing any single
compare-exchange instruction.

<p>
Given a CE-program <i><b>P</b></i>, what is the minimum number of
instructions that should be added at the end of program <i><b>P</b></i>
in order to make it reliable?

<p><b>Example:</b></p>

<p>
Consider the following 3-register CE-program: CE(1,2); CE(2,3); CE(1,2).
<br>
In order to make this program reliable it suffices to
add only two extra instructions, namely CE(1,3)
and CE(1,2).

<p>
Write a program that reads the description of a CE-program,
and determines the minimum number of CE-instructions that
should be added to make this program reliable.

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<b>
The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating
the number of the cases following, each of them as described below.
This line is followed by a blank line, and there is also a blank line between
two consecutive inputs.
</b>
<p>
<p>

<p>
The first line of input contains the number of registers <i><b>n</b></i>,
where 
<i><b>0 &le; n &le; 1000</b></i>,
followed by the number of program instructions <i><b>m</b></i>,
where 
<i><b>0 &le; m &le; 3000</b></i>.

<p>
The next line contains the program itself: a sequence of <i><b>2m</b></i> integers,
separated by spaces, where each CE-instruction consists of
two consecutive integers
on positions <i><b>2j-1</b></i> and <i><b>2j</b></i>, with <i><b>1 &le; j &le; m</b></i>.

Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<b>
For each test case, the output must follow the description below.
The outputs of two consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.
</b>
<p>
<p>
<p>
The output consists of a single integer: the minimal number of instructions
that should be added to the input program in order to make this
program reliable.
