``ABEAS Corp.'' is a very
small company that owns a single airplane. The customers of ABEAS Corp
are large airline companies which rent the airplane to accommodate
occasional overcapacity.

<p>
Custommers send renting orders that consist of a time interval and a
price that the custommer is ready to pay for renting the airplane
during the given time period.

<p>
Orders of all the custommers are known in advance. Of course, not all
orders can be acomodated and some orders have to be declined. Eugene
LAWLER, the Chief Scientific Officer of ABEAS Corp would like to maximize
the profit of the company.

<p>
You are requested to compute an optimal solution.

<p>

<p>
<br>
Consider for instance the case where the company has 4 orders AF514
(start time 0, duration 5, price 10), CO5 (start time 3, duration 7,
price 14), AF515 (start time 5, duration 9, price 7) and BA01 (start
time 6, duration 9, price 8). The optimal solution consists in
declining CO5 and AF515 and the gain is 10 + 8 = 18. Note that the
solution made of AF514 and AF515 is feasible (the airplane is rented
with no interruption from time 0 to time 14) but non-optimal.

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>
Input consists of several test cases, each of them following the description below. A blank line
separates two consecutive cases.

<p>
Each test case is described by one <tt>input</tt> file that contains all
the relevant data: The first line contains the number <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span> of orders

<span class="MATH">(<i>n</i><img width="18" height="30" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="2942img1.png" alt="$ \le$">3000)</span>. This line is followed by <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span>
lines. Each of which describes an order and contains the name
identifier of the order (less than 80 characters, with no white space)
followed by three integer values: the start time of the order, the
duration of the order and the price the custommer is ready to pay for
this order (white spaces are used as separators). We assume that
orders have a strictly positive duration. You can assume that all relevant
times, prices, and costs are strictly less than <span class="MATH">2<sup>31</sup></span>.

Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>
For each test case, you are required to compute an optimal solution for each input
file. Your program has to write the total price paid by airlines.

<p>
The outputs of two consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.
