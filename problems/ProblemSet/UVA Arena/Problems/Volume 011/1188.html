Suhan and Laina live in an <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span>-dimensional city where there are <span class="MATH"><i>n</i> + 1</span> locations.
Any two locations (consider these locations as points) are equidistant from each
other and connected by only one bi-directional road. They love to roam together
around the city on their favourite bi-verbal (A kind of vehicle). Kiri, a tenth
generation robot also lives in the same city and wants to kill Suhan out of jealousy.
That is why Suhan and Laina are very careful about keeping their thoughts and plans
secret. Therefore nobody knows:

<p>
<dl compact="">
<dt>a)</dt>
<dd>Where Suhan and Laina lives.
</dd>
<dt>b)</dt>
<dd>What their destination location is.
</dd>
<dt>c)</dt>
<dd>Which roads will they use?
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
So their journey can start from any location, ends in another location and they may
use any road sequence they like. Their destination location may be same or different
than the source location. For example when their tour is guaranteed to be a simple
cycle their source and destination location are same.

<p>
Given the number of locations in the city (<span class="MATH"><i>L</i></span>) you will have to find the expected
cost (often considered as average) of one of their single travelling. You can assume
that the cost of travelling from one location to another through the direct (also
shortest) path is 1 universal joule.

<p>
The input file contains several lines of input. Each line contains a single integer
<span class="MATH"><i>L</i></span> 
<span class="MATH">(15 <img width="18" height="30" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="2700img1.gif" alt="$ \geq$"> <i>L</i> &gt; 2)</span> that indicates the number of locations in the city. Input is
terminated by a line where value of <span class="MATH"><i>L</i></span> is zero. This line should not be processed.

Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>
For each line of input produce one line of output. This line contains three
floating-point numbers <span class="MATH"><i>F</i><sub>1</sub></span>, <span class="MATH"><i>F</i><sub>2</sub></span>, <span class="MATH"><i>F</i><sub>3</sub></span>. Here <span class="MATH"><i>F</i><sub>1</sub></span> is the expected cost when
they travel along a path, <span class="MATH"><i>F</i><sub>2</sub></span> is the expected cost when it is guaranteed that
they travel along a simple path and <span class="MATH"><i>F</i><sub>3</sub></span> is the expected cost when it is guaranteed
that they travel along a simple cycle. All the floating point numbers should be
rounded up to four digits after the decimal point. You must assume that their
travelling cost is not greater than <span class="MATH"><i>L</i></span>. Travelling cost is always expressed in
universal joule.
