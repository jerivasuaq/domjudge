<p>
Consider a problem of finding the best possible solution of a new kind of right alignment of two strings. As an example, here is the best such right alignment for two strings <tt>AADDEFGGHC</tt> and <tt>ADCDEGH</tt>: 

<p>
<tt>AAD-DEFGGHC</tt>

<p>

<p>
<br>
<tt>&nbsp;ADCDE--GH-</tt>

<p>

<p>
<br>
Each vertical matching position scores 2, and each continuous run of gaps scores -1. Thus the total score of an alignment is twice the number of matching positions, less the number of continuous runs of gaps. In the given example, six positions (<tt>A</tt>, <tt>D</tt>, <tt>D</tt>, <tt>E</tt>, <tt>G</tt>, <tt>H</tt>) match, and three runs of gaps are introduced. Thus the score of this alignment is 
<span class="MATH">2 <tt>x</tt> 6 + (- 1) <tt>x</tt> 3 = 9</span> . Note that we do not penalize for misalignment at the left, as we only consider the problem of finding the best right alignment.

<p>
You are to write a program that finds the score of the best right alignment for any two given strings.

<h2><font size="4" color="#ff0000"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">
Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>
The first line of the input file contains an integer <span class="MATH"><i>N</i></span> 
<span class="MATH">(1<img width="18" height="31" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="2352img1.png" alt="$ \le$"><i>N</i><img width="18" height="31" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="2352img1.png" alt="$ \le$">10, 000)</span> indicating the number of test cases to follow. Each test case consists of two lines each of which contains a string of length at most 50. The strings are composed entirely of alpha-numeric characters. 

<p>

<h2><font size="4" color="#ff0000"><a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">
Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>
For each test case in the input print a line containing the score of the best possible right alignment of the two given strings.
