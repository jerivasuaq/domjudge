<p>
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), an atypical pneumonia of unknown aetiology, was recognized as
   a global threat in mid-March 2003. To minimize transmission to others, the best strategy is to separate
   the suspects from others.

<p>
In the Not-Spreading-Your-Sickness University (NSYSU), there are many student groups. Students in the
   same group intercommunicate with each other frequently, and a student may join several groups. To prevent
   the possible transmissions of SARS, the NSYSU collects the member lists of all student groups, and makes
   the following rule in their standard operation procedure (SOP).

<p>
<div align="CENTER">
Once a member in a group is a suspect, all members in the group are suspects.

</div>

<p>
However, they find that it is not easy to identify all the suspects when a student is recognized as a suspect.
   Your job is to write a program which finds all the suspects.

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>
The input file contains several cases. Each test case begins with two integers <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span> and <span class="MATH"><i>m</i></span> in a line, where <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span>
is the number of students, and <span class="MATH"><i>m</i></span> is the number of groups. You may assume that 
<span class="MATH">0 &lt; <i>n</i><img width="18" height="30" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="2817img1.gif" alt="$ \le$">30000</span> and 
<span class="MATH">0<img width="18" height="30" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="2817img1.gif" alt="$ \le$"><i>m</i><img width="18" height="30" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="2817img1.gif" alt="$ \le$">500</span>.
Every student is numbered by a unique integer between 0 and <span class="MATH"><i>n</i> - 1</span>, and initially student 0 is recognized as a suspect
in all the cases. This line is followed by <span class="MATH"><i>m</i></span> member lists of the groups, one line per group. Each line begins with
an integer <span class="MATH"><i>k</i></span> by itself representing the number of members in the group. Following the number of members, there
are <span class="MATH"><i>k</i></span> integers representing the students in this group. All the integers in a line are separated by at least one space.

<p>
A case wit <span class="MATH"><i>n</i> = 0</span> and <span class="MATH"><i>m</i> = 0</span> indicates the end of the input, and need not be processed.
