ZSoft  Corp.  is  a  software  company  in  GaoKe  Hall.  And  the  workers  in  the  hall  are  very hard-working.
But the elevator in that hall always drives them crazy. Why? Because there is only one elevator in GaoKe Hall, while
there are hundreds of companies in it. Every morning, people must waste a lot of time waiting for the elevator.

<p>
Hal,  a smart  guy  in  ZSoft,  wants  to  change  this  situation.  He  wants  to  find  a  way  to  make  the
elevator work more effectively. But it's not an easy job.

<p>

<p>
<br>
There are 31 floors in GaoKe Hall. It takes 4 seconds for the elevator to raise one floor. It means:

<p>
It  costs  
<span class="MATH">(31 - 1)&#215;4 = 120</span> seconds  if  the  elevator  goes  from  the  1-st  floor  to
the  31-st  floor without stop. And the elevator stops 10 second once. So, if the elevator stops at
each floor, it will cost  
<span class="MATH">30&#215;4 + 29&#215;10 = 410</span> seconds (It is not  necessary to calculate the
stopping time  at 31st floor). In another  way, it takes 20 seconds for the  workers  to  go  up  or down one
floor. It takes 
<span class="MATH">30&#215;20 = 600</span> seconds for them to walk from the 1-st floor to the 31-st
floor. Obviously, it is not a good idea. So some people choose to use the elevator to get a floor which is the
nearest to their office.

<p>

<p>
<br>
After thinking over for a long time, Hal finally found a way to improve this situation. He told the elevator
man his idea: First, the elevator man asks the people which  floors they want to go. He will then design a stopping
plan which minimize the time the last person need to arrive the floor where his office locates. For example, if
the elevator is required to stop at the 4-th, 5-th and 10-th floor, the stopping
plan would be: the elevator stops at 4-th and 10-th floor. Because the elevator will arrive

<span class="MATH">4<sup>th</sup></span> floor at 
<span class="MATH">3&#215;4 = 12</span> second, then it will stop 10 seconds, then it will arrive 
<span class="MATH">10<sup>th</sup></span>
floor at 
<span class="MATH">3&#215;4 + 10 + 6&#215;4 = 46</span> second. People  who  want to  go  4-th  floor  will  reach
their  office  at  12 second, people who want to go to 5-th floor will reach at  
<span class="MATH">12 + 20 = 32</span> second
and people who want to go to 10-th floor will reach at 46 second. Therefore it takes 46 seconds for the
last person to reach his office. It is a good deal for all people.

<p>
Now, you are supposed to write a program to help the elevator man to design the stopping plan, which minimize the
time the last person needs to arrive at his floor.

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>
The input consists of several testcases. Each testcase is in a single line as the following:

<p>

<p>
<div align="CENTER" class="mathdisplay">
<i>n</i>&nbsp;<i>f</i><sub>1</sub>&nbsp;<i>f</i><sub>2</sub>&nbsp;...&nbsp;<i>f</i><sub>n</sub>
</div><p>

<p>
It means, there are totally <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span> floors at which the elevator need to stop, and <span class="MATH"><i>n</i> = 0</span> means no testcases any more.

<span class="MATH"><i>f</i><sub>1</sub>&nbsp;<i>f</i><sub>2</sub>&nbsp;...&nbsp;<i>f</i><sub>n</sub></span> are the floors at which the elevator is to be stopped
(<span class="MATH"><i>n</i><img width="18" height="30" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="2949img1.png" alt="$ \le$">30</span>,

Every number is separated by a single space.

<p>
For each testcase, output the time the last reading person needs in the first line and the stopping floors in
the second line. Please note that there is a summary of the floors at the head of the second line. There may be
several solutions, any appropriate one is accepted. No extra spaces are allowed.
