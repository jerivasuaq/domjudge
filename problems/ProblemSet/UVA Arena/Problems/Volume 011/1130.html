<p>
Every morning you have to drive to your workplace.
Unfortunately, roads are under constant repair. Fortunately,
administration is aware that this may cause trouble and they enforce a
strict rule on roadblocks: roads must be blocked only half of the
time.
However, contractors are free to schedule their working hours, still
they must follow regulations:

<p>

<ul>
<li>Working periods (when the road is blocked) and rest periods
(when the road is open) must alternate and be of fixed length.
</li>
<li>The beginning of the day (time zero) must coincide with the
beginning of a period.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Write a program that, given a description of the road network and of
contractors schedules outputs the minimal time needed to drive from
home to work.

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>
Input consists of several test cases, each of them following the description below. A blank line
separates two consecutive cases.

<p>
The road network is represented on a 
<span class="MATH"><i>N</i>&#215;<i>N</i></span> grid and
the first line of the input consists in the number <span class="MATH"><i>N</i></span>, 
<span class="MATH">2<img width="18" height="30" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="2939img1.png" alt="$ \le$"><i>N</i><img width="18" height="30" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="2939img1.png" alt="$ \le$">50</span>.

<p>
Then, come <span class="MATH"><i>N</i></span> lines of <span class="MATH"><i>N</i></span> characters that represent the road network
at time zero. Those lines are made of ``<tt>.</tt>'' (standing for open road)
and ``<tt>*</tt>'' (standing for roadblock) and they encode the rows
of the grid in increasing order, while columns are also presented in
increasing order. Conventionally, your home is at the position first row, first column,
while your workplace is at the position last row, last column.
Furthermore, you leave home at time <span class="MATH"><i>t</i> = 0</span>, that is, your starting
position is first row, first column at time zero.

<p>
At a given time <span class="MATH"><i>t</i></span>, your car must be on some ``open road''
cell. It takes one unit of time to drive to any of the four
adjacent cells heading toward north, south, west or east, and you may
also choose to stay on the same cell for one unit of time.
Of course, those five moves are valid if and only if the targeted cell
exists and is free at time <span class="MATH"><i>t</i> + 1</span>.

<p>
Finally, come <span class="MATH"><i>N</i></span> lines of <span class="MATH"><i>N</i></span> characters that represent the
contractors schedules. Those lines match the ones of the grid
description and are made of <span class="MATH"><i>N</i></span> characters `<tt>0</tt>, <tt>1</tt>,
..., <tt>9</tt>' that specify the duration of the working (and rest)
period for a given cell. Observe that `<tt>0</tt>' is a bit special, since it means that the
corresponding cell status does not change.

Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>
For each input case, the output consists in a single line, holding either the requested time, or
`<tt>NO</tt>', if driving from home to work is not possible.

<p>
The outputs of two consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.
