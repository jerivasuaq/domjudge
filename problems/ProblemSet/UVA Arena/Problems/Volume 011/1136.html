<p>
In Episode III of Star Wars (whose alleged
title is <em>How I became Vader</em>), R2-D2 (Artoo-Detoo) is again
confronted to a tedious work. He is responsible for the loading of
the republic transport starships in the fastest way. Imagine a huge
space area where <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span> starships are parked. Each starship has a
capacity of <span class="MATH"><i>K</i></span> cubic femtoparsec. Containers <span class="MATH"><i>C</i><sub>i</sub></span> arrive one at a time
with some volume <span class="MATH"><i>v</i><sub>i</sub></span> (expressed in cubic femtoparsec). R2-D2 wants to
minimize the number of starships used for a given sequence of containers.

<p>
Smart as he is, R2-D2 knows for sure that the problem is a hard one,
even with the force being around. Here is the heuristics he selected
to solve his problem. Start with
all starships ready to load, and numbered <span class="MATH"><i>S</i><sub>0</sub></span>, <span class="MATH"><i>S</i><sub>1</sub></span>, etc.. When
container <span class="MATH"><i>C</i><sub>j</sub></span> arrives, select the starship of minimal index <span class="MATH"><i>i</i></span> that can
contain <span class="MATH"><i>C</i><sub>j</sub></span> and put it in <span class="MATH"><i>S</i><sub>i</sub></span>. In some sense, this heuristics
minimizes the move of the container arriving before its loading.

<p>
At the end of the <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span> arrivals, R2-D2 counts the number <span class="MATH"><i>s</i></span> of
starships used and he measures the <em>total waste</em> <span class="MATH"><i>w</i></span> of the sequence. For
<span class="MATH"><i>i</i> = 0..<i>s</i> - 1</span>, the <em>waste</em> in starship <span class="MATH"><i>i</i></span> is given by the unused volume.

<p>
Your task is to simulate the algorithm of R2-D2.

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>
Input consists of several test cases, each of them following the description below. A blank line
separates two consecutive cases.

<p>
Each test file begins with capacity <span class="MATH"><i>K</i></span> on a line 
<span class="MATH">(<i>K</i><img width="18" height="30" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="2945img1.png" alt="$ \le$">1000)</span>,
followed by the number of containers in the sequence, <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span> on the
second line 
<span class="MATH">(1<img width="18" height="30" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="2945img1.png" alt="$ \le$"><i>n</i><img width="18" height="30" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="2945img1.png" alt="$ \le$">10<sup>6</sup>)</span>. There are two possible formats for
the remaining lines. If it contains one integer, then this is the next
<span class="MATH"><i>v</i><sub>i</sub></span>. If it begins with the character `<tt>b</tt>' (for block), it is
followed by 2 integers <span class="MATH"><i>r</i></span> and <span class="MATH"><i>v</i></span>. This means that the <span class="MATH"><i>r</i></span> next
containers arriving have volume <span class="MATH"><i>v</i></span>.

Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>
For each test case, your program must output the number <span class="MATH"><i>s</i></span> of starships used, followed by
a blank, followed by the total waste <span class="MATH"><i>w</i></span>.

<p>
The outputs of two consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.

<p>

<p>
<br>
In the first sample input below, you load starship <span class="MATH"><i>S</i><sub>0</sub></span> with 50 and 25 and starship <span class="MATH"><i>S</i><sub>1</sub></span> with
70, so that the waste is (100-75)+(100-70)=55. The answer must be `<tt>2 55</tt>'

<p>
The second case which corresponds to the sequence 50, 40, 40, 20. <span class="MATH"><i>S</i><sub>0</sub></span> will
contain 90, <span class="MATH"><i>S</i><sub>1</sub></span> will contain 60, so that the waste is 10+40=50
and the answer will be: `<tt>2 50</tt>'.
