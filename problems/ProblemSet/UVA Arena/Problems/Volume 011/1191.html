Hermes, the Greek God of Speed, has created a two-dimensional colony Massilia in space.
The colony, consisting of one or more provinces, can be represented by a linear equation
in 3-dimensional space. In each province there are 3 or 4 cities, each being on their
convex hull. Now, citizens of each province want to create road network connecting cities
of their own province. Unfortunately, materials for road construction are not available
in the colony, and can only be transported from Earth. Total material required to construct
the roads will be proportional to their length. This is why they are interested to build
road networks of shortest length connecting different cities of a province. In order to
minimize length of each network they are also ready to make junctions away from cities,
if so required.

<p>
Unfortunately creatures of the colony are pretty weak in mathematics and algorithms.
They have, therefore, decided to take services of `<em>homo sapiens</em>' of earth, who are believed
to be good in mathematics and algorithms. Accordingly the chief of Massilia sent an email
to Academy of Computers and Mathematics (ACM) with Head Quarters at Dhaka to solve the problem.
ACM has now asked you to help out our friends in Massilia.

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>
The colony is described by an equation 
<span class="MATH"><i>ax</i> + <i>by</i> + <i>cz</i> = <i>d</i></span>. There are <span class="MATH"><i>N</i></span> provinces in the colony.
A city in a province can be described by a point in 3-dimension like
<span class="MATH">(<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>)</span>. All the <span class="MATH"><i>x</i></span>, <span class="MATH"><i>y</i></span> and <span class="MATH"><i>z</i></span> coordinates will be within <span class="MATH">-100.00</span> and <span class="MATH">100.00</span>.
The first line of input will contain <span class="MATH"><i>a</i></span>, <span class="MATH"><i>b</i></span>, <span class="MATH"><i>c</i></span> and <span class="MATH"><i>d</i></span>. Then the number of
provinces (<span class="MATH"><i>N</i></span>) in the colony will be given in the second line. The remaining lines will
describe each province one by one.

<p>
The description of a province starts with the number of cities <span class="MATH"><i>M</i></span> (
<span class="MATH">3 <img width="18" height="30" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="2703img1.gif" alt="$ \leq$"> <i>M</i> <img width="18" height="30" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="2703img1.gif" alt="$ \leq$"> 4</span>) in
the province in a line followed by <span class="MATH"><i>M</i></span> lines. Each line contains 3 numbers describing respectively
the <span class="MATH"><i>x</i></span>, <span class="MATH"><i>y</i></span> and <span class="MATH"><i>z</i></span> coordinates of a city in that province.

Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>
You should print one line for each province in the input data as follows:

<p>

<p>
<br>

<tt>Province # <span class="MATH"><i>p</i></span> : <span class="MATH"><i>L</i></span></tt>

<p>

<p>
<br>
Where <span class="MATH"><i>p</i></span> is the serial number of the province as they appear in the input.

<span class="MATH">1 <img width="18" height="30" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="2703img1.gif" alt="$ \leq$"> <i>p</i> <img width="18" height="30" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="2703img1.gif" alt="$ \leq$"> <i>N</i></span>, and <span class="MATH"><i>L</i></span> is the minimum length of the road network for that province.
<span class="MATH"><i>L</i></span> should contain two digits after the decimal point and should be exact up to 2
decimal points.
