Many people like to solve hard puzzles some of which may lead them to
madness. One such puzzle could be finding a hidden prime number in a
given text. Such number could be the number of different substrings of
a given size that exist in the text. As you soon will discover, you
really need the help of a computer and a good algorithm to solve such
a puzzle.

<p>
Your task is to write a program that given the size, N, of the
substring, the number of different characters that may occur in the
text, NC, and the text itself, determines the number of different
substrings of size N that appear in the text.

<p>
As an example, consider N=3, NC=4 and the text "daababac". The
different substrings of size 3 that can be found in this text are:
"daa"; "aab"; "aba"; "bab"; "bac". Therefore, the answer should be 5.

<h2><font size="4" color="#ff0000"><a name="SECTION0001001000000000000000">
Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>
<b>
The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating
the number of the cases following, each of them as described below.
This line is followed by a blank line, and there is also a blank line between
two consecutive inputs.
</b>
<p>
The first line of input consists of two numbers, N and NC, separated
by exactly one space. This is followed by the text where the search
takes place. You may assume that the maximum number of substrings
formed by the possible set of characters does not exceed 16 Millions.

Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>
<b>
For each test case, the output must follow the description below.
The outputs of two consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.
</b>
<p>
The program should output just an integer corresponding to the number
of different substrings of size N found in the given text.
