<p>
The classical Maya civilization prospered in what today is
southern Mexico, Guatemala, Belize and northern Honduras. 
During the height of the Maya civilization they developed 
a sophisticated system for 
time keeping used both to record history and for
divinatory rituals. Their calendar consisted of
three components: the Tzolkin, the Haab and the Long Count.

<p>
For divinatory purposes the Maya used the Tzolkin which was composed
of 20 day names to which a numeric coefficient from 1 to 13 was
attached, giving a total of 260 distinct combinations. This is the 
size of the Tzolkin, or ritual year.
From Spanish colonial sources, we know the names of the days:

<blockquote>
<b>Day names</b>: I<small>MIX, </small>I<small>K, </small>A<small>KBAL, </small>K<small>AN, </small>C<small>HIKCHAN, </small>K<small>IMI, </small>M<small>ANIK, </small>L<small>AMAT, </small>M<small>ULUK, </small>O<small>K,
</small>C<small>HUEN, </small>E<small>B,  </small>B<small>EN, </small>I<small>X, </small>M<small>EN, </small>K<small>IB, </small>K<small>ABAN, </small>E<small>TZNAB, </small>K<small>AWAK, </small>A<small>JAW</small>
</blockquote>

<p>
For example, the sequence of days starting at 9.I<small>MIX</small> 
is:
9.I<small>MIX&nbsp;/ 10.</small>I<small>K&nbsp;/ 11.</small>A<small>KBAL&nbsp;/ 12.</small>K<small>AN&nbsp;/ 13.</small>C<small>HIKCHAN&nbsp;/ 1.</small>K<small>IMI&nbsp;/
2.</small>M<small>ANIK&nbsp;/...</small>

<p>
The Haab calendar was used for astronomy. It had 365 days divided 
into 19 months each with 20 days, except the last one which had only 
5. In a manner similar to the Tzolkin each month name has a number 
from 1 to 20 indicating the day number within the month.
Again, from Spanish colonial sources, we know the names of the months:
<blockquote>
<b>Month names</b>: P<small>OHP, </small>W<small>O, </small>S<small>IP, </small>Z<small>OTZ, </small>S<small>EK, </small>X<small>UL, </small>Y<small>AXKIN, </small>M<small>OL, </small>C<small>HEN, </small>Y<small>AX, </small>S<small>AK, </small>K<small>EH, </small>M<small>AK,
</small>K<small>ANKIN, </small>M<small>UAN, </small>P<small>AX, </small>K<small>AYAB, </small>K<small>UMKU, </small>W<small>AYEB</small>
</blockquote>

<p>
The month W<small>AYEB</small> had just 5 days and was considered an unlucky time of
the year. 

<p>
The Tzolkin and Haab were combined in the inscriptions to create the 
so called Calendar Round, combining the 260 day cycle of the Tzolkin 
and the 365 day cycle of the Haab. A typical Calendar Round date 
in the inscriptions might be: ``3.L<small>AMAT 6.</small>P<small>AX</small>''. Note that not all of 
the combination of days, months and coefficients are possible. How many
days does it take to repeat a Calendar Round?

<p>
A typical sequence of days in the Calendar Round starting for example
at ``3.L<small>AMAT 6.</small>P<small>AX</small>'': 
<blockquote>
3.L<small>AMAT&nbsp;6.</small>P<small>AX&nbsp;/ 4.</small>M<small>ULUK&nbsp;7.</small>P<small>AX&nbsp;/ 5.</small>O<small>K&nbsp;8.</small>P<small>AX&nbsp;/ 6.</small>C<small>HUEN&nbsp;9.</small>P<small>AX&nbsp;/
 7.</small>E<small>B&nbsp;10.</small>P<small>AX&nbsp;/ 8.</small>B<small>EN&nbsp;11.</small>P<small>AX&nbsp;/ 9.</small>I<small>X&nbsp;12.</small>P<small>AX&nbsp;/ 10.</small>M<small>EN&nbsp;13.</small>P<small>AX&nbsp;/ 
 11.</small>K<small>IB&nbsp;14.</small>P<small>AX&nbsp;/ 12.</small>K<small>ABAN&nbsp;15.</small>P<small>AX&nbsp;/ 13.</small>E<small>TZNAB&nbsp;16.</small>P<small>AX&nbsp;/ 1.</small>K<small>AWAK&nbsp;17.</small>P<small>AX&nbsp;/
 2.</small>A<small>JAW&nbsp;18.</small>P<small>AX&nbsp;/ 3.</small>I<small>MIX&nbsp;19.</small>P<small>AX&nbsp;/ 4.</small>I<small>K&nbsp;20.</small>P<small>AX&nbsp;/ 5.</small>A<small>KBAL&nbsp;1.</small>K<small>AYAB&nbsp;/
 6.</small>K<small>AN&nbsp;2.</small>K<small>AYAB&nbsp;/ ...</small>
</blockquote>

<p>
Finally, at the beginning of the Classic Period (AD 200-900) the
Maya developed an absolute calendar called Long Count which counted
the number of days starting from a fixed date. Currently, most researchers 
agree that this zero date was August&nbsp;13, 3114&nbsp;BC. According to Maya 
belief this was the date of creation of our world.
Dates in the Long Count are written (for simplicity) in 5-tuples of the 
form: ``9.2.3.4.5''. Such a date reads ``9 baktuns 2 katuns 3 tuns 4
winals 5 kin since the zero date''. A ``kin'' is just one day. A 
``winal'' is a group of 20 days. A ``tun'' is a group of 18 winals (thus a tun
has <i><b>20&times; 18</b></i> = 360 days, 5 days short of a year).
From here on 
all units come in multiples of 20. Thus a ``katun'' is 20 tuns (almost 20
years) and a ``baktun'' is 20 katuns (almost 400 years). 
Thus  the date ``9.2.3.4.5''
means ``
<i><b>9&times; 144000 + 2&times; 7200 + 3&times; 360 +
4&times; 20 + 5</b></i> days after the zero date''.

<p>
Given the periodicity of the Calendar Round, a legal 
date such as ``3.L<small>AMAT 6.</small>P<small>AX</small>'' has multiple occurrences in the Long 
Count. Thus, one difficulty in reading Maya inscriptions is establishing
the correspondence between a date given only in the 
Calendar Round and the absolute date in the Long Count. 
In this case, we must compute all the
possible Long Count dates associated with the particular Calendar
Round and deduce which one
applies based on context information (for example,
using references to a king whose lifespan is known).

<p>
Write a program that computes
all possible Long Count dates corresponding to a given
Calendar Round date. Only the
Long Count dates in the Baktuns 8 and 9 are of interest to us (they
cover all the Classic Period).

<p>
As a starting point, you are given the information that the Long Count date
8.0.0.0.0 occurred on
the Calendar Round ``9.A<small>JAW&nbsp;3.</small>S<small>IP</small>''.
