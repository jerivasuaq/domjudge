Eric has a classic football that is made of 32 pieces of leather: 12 black
pentagons and 20 white hexagons. Each pentagon adjoins 5 hexagons and each
hexagon adjoins 3 pentagons and 3 hexagons. Eric drew a polygon (i.e. a
closed line without intersections) along the edges of the pieces. The
polygon divided the ball into two parts and Eric painted one of them green.

He is curious if given the description of the polygon you are able to
compute the number of black, white and green pieces?

<p>

<p>
<br>
Write a program that:

<p>

<ul>
<li>reads the description of the polygon from the standard input,
</li>
<li>computes the number of black, white and green pieces,
</li>
<li>writes the result to the standard output.
</li>
</ul>

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>
Input consists of several test case, each separated by a blank line. The first line of the file indicates the number of test cases, and it's followed by a blank line.
<p>

<p>
The first line of the input contains one integer <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span> being the number of
vertices of the polygon. The second line of the input contains <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span> integers

<span class="MATH"><i>a</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>a</i><sub>2</sub>,..., <i>a</i><sub>n</sub></span> separated by single spaces. Integer <span class="MATH"><i>a</i><sub>i</sub></span> (equal 1 or
2) is the number of green pieces adjoining the <span class="MATH"><i>i</i></span>-th vertex of the
polygon. The side of the polygon connecting the <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span>-th and the first vertex
always lies between two hexagons.

Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>
For each test case, the first and only line of the output contains three integers <span class="MATH"><i>b</i></span>, <span class="MATH"><i>w</i></span> and
<span class="MATH"><i>g</i></span>. These are the numbers of black, white and green pieces respectively.

<p>
The outputs of two consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.
