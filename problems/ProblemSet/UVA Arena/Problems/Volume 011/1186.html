Suppose there are a number of good users using an Internet chat room, which is a
shared text chat space. Now there are some bad guys in the Internet who would come
to this room and would have no respect or interest in the topic of discussion in
the group. They would start typing strings of garbage characters, start unsolicited
advertisements of certain URLs or businesses, or paste same string again and again
just to disturb others in the room.

<p>
When I asked about this problem to Prof Banku (naturally not as smart as Prof Shanku)
he suggested the following scheme. Let us define consonants to be all letters in a-z
and A-Z except a, e, i, o, u, y, A, E, I, O, U and Y.

<p>
A user should be able to send a line to the chat room unless

<p>

<ul>
<li>the line has more than 5 consecutive consonants, or
</li>
<li>the line contains at least one word which has more than 4 consecutive
        consonants and the user sent more than 2 such lines (containing more 
than four consonants) in last 10 lines sent, or
</li>
<li>the user sent the same line more than once in last 10 sentences sent.</li></ul>
where "last 10 lines sent" means last 10 lines (acceptable or not) sent by user, excluding the current line.

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>

<p>
Input consists of several lines. The first line contains an integer <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span>, which is
the number of lines in the shared text space. Then follow <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span> lines each consisting
of not more than 200 ASCII characters.

Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>
For each line of input print `<tt>y</tt>' if the line is acceptable according to the
criteria set above and `<tt>n</tt>' otherwise in separate lines. See the sample
output for example.
