You must have heard of the Josephus problem in connection with link lists. It dealt with finding the only survivor among <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span> persons. Here you have a game with a rather happy outcome. Suppose <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span> players stand in a circle. Counting from player number 1 every alternate player is temporarily removed (for example, at first 2 is removed) to finally end up with the single survivor. After the survivor has been determined each player with number higher than the survivor is paid Tk. 1 and permanently removed from the circle. The same operation is repeated with the remaining players, and players with number higher than the survivor are paid Tk. 1 each and removed from the circle again. Once such an operation fails to decrease the number of players in the circle, each of them is paid Tk. 2 and the game ends. Your problem is to determine total amount of money Josephus will have to pay to all players.

For example, with 5 players in the first round survivor is 3, so players number 4 and 5 are paid Taka 1 each and removed from the game. In the next round survivor is player number 3 again. Consequently no one could be removed, therefore each of them is paid Taka 2, so in total 
<span class="MATH">(2 + 2 <tt>x</tt> 3 =)</span> 8 will be paid for this game.
