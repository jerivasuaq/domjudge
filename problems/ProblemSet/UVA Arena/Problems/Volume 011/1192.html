Molecular biologists frequently compare bio-sequences to see if any similarities can be 
found in the hope that what is true of one sequence is also true of its analogue.  In this 
problem, we focus on nucleic acid sequences that are composed of four symbols `A', `C', 
`G' or `T'. Generally, such comparisons involve aligning sections of the two sequences in 
a way that exposes the similarities between them.  Given a query sequence and a set of 
sequences stored in a database, you are asked to write a program that searches the 
database and finds the sequence having the largest similarity score with the query 
sequence.   

<p>
The similarity score between the query sequence and a database sequence is the 
sum of the alignment scores of the aligned pairs of symbols from an alignment of the 
two sequences.  Two identical symbols that are aligned are given a score of +5 while a 
mismatched pair of symbols is assigned a score of -4.  A gap is introduced into an 
alignment if one symbol in one sequence is not aligned with symbols in the other.  The 
penalty for a gap is a score of -7.  For example, given a query sequence <span class="MATH"><i>m</i></span>=`<tt>GAAGGCA</tt>' 
and a database sequence <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span>=`<tt>GCAGAGCA</tt>', the following alignment between them 
(aligned pairs of symbols are written one above the other) has a similarity score of 
5+(-4)+5+5+(-7)+5+5+5=21. 

<p>
<pre><tt>
    Sequence <span class="MATH"><i>m</i></span>: <tt>G A A G - G C A</tt> 
<br>
Sequence <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span>: 		 <tt>G C A G A G C A</tt>
</tt></pre>

<p>
Note that a gap in the above alignment is represented by the symbol `<tt>-</tt>'.   The 
dynamic programming algorithm provides a rigorous mathematical approach towards 
this alignment problem.

The input consists a query sequence (on the first two lines) and a set of data sequences 
(each occupying two lines).  Each sequence has the following format:
