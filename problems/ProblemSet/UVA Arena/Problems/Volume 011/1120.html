Though it might be hard to imagine, the
inhabitants of a small country Additivia do not know of such thing
as change, which probably has to do with them
not knowing subtraction either. 
When they buy something, 
they always need to have the exact amount of addollars, their currency. 
The only other option, but not 
a really attractive one, is over-paying.

<p>
Professor Adem, one of the Additivian mathematicians 
came up with an algorithm for keeping a balanced 
portfolio. The idea is the following. 
Suppose you have more coins of value <i><b>v<sub>1</sub></b></i> than coins of value 
<i><b>v<sub>2</sub></b></i>. In this case you should try to spend at least as many 
coins of value <i><b>v<sub>1</sub></b></i> as those of value 
<i><b>v<sub>2</sub></b></i> on any buy you make. 
Of course spending too many <i><b>v<sub>1</sub></b></i> coins is not a good idea either, but to make 
the algorithm simpler professor Adem decided 
to ignore the problem. The algorithm became an instant hit
and professor Adem is now designing a kind of ``electronic portfolio'' 
with built-in Adem's algorithm.
All he needs now is a software for these machines, 
that will decide whether a given amount of
addollars can be paid using a given set of coins according 
to the rules of Adem's algorithm.
Needless to say, you are his chosen programmer for the task.

<p>
Write a program that 
reads the description of a set of coins and an amount of addollars
to be paid,
and determines whether you can pay that amount
according to Professor Adem's rules.

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<b>
The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating
the number of the cases following, each of them as described below.
This line is followed by a blank line, and there is also a blank line between
two consecutive inputs.
</b>
<p>
<p>

<p>
The input starts with the amount of 
addollars to be paid <i><b>x</b></i>, where 
<i><b>1 &le; x &le; 100 000</b></i>. 
The number of different coin values <i><b>k</b></i> follows,
where <i><b>1 &le; k &le; 5</b></i>.
The values of the coins 
<i><b>v<sub>1</sub>,...,v<sub>k</sub></b></i> follow,
where 
<i><b>1 &le; v<sub>i</sub> &le; 10 000</b></i>.

<p>
Notice that the order among coin values is significant:
you need to spend at least as many coins of value <i><b>v<sub>1</sub></b></i> as coins
of value <i><b>v<sub>2</sub></b></i>, at least as many coins of value <i><b>v<sub>2</sub></b></i>"> as
those of value
<i><b>v<sub>3</sub></b></i>, and so on. You may assume
that you have a sufficiently large number of coins of each value.

For each test case, the output must follow the description below.

<p>
Your program should output either
a single word ``<tt>YES</tt>'', if the given amount can
be paid according to the rules, or a single word ``<tt>NO</tt>'' otherwise.
