<p>
Project managers, such as the UNIX utility <tt>make</tt>,
are used to maintain large software projects made up from
many components.
Users write a <i>project file</i> specifying which components
(called <i>tasks</i>) depend
on others and the project manager can
automatically update the components in the correct order.

<p>
Write a program that reads a project file
and outputs the order in which the tasks should be performed.

Input</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<b>
The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating
the number of the cases following, each of them as described below.
This line is followed by a blank line, and there is also a blank line between
two consecutive inputs.
</b>
<p>
<p>

<p>
For simplicity we represent each task by an integer number
from 
<i><b>1,2,...,N</b></i> (where <i><b>N</b></i> is the total number of tasks).
The first line of input specifies the number <i><b>N</b></i> of tasks
and the number <i><b>M</b></i> of rules,
such that 
<i><b>N &le; 100</b></i>, <i><b>M &le; 100</b></i>.

<p>
The rest of the input consists of <i><b>M</b></i> <i>rules</i>, one in each line,
specifying dependencies using the following syntax:
<br><br>
<i><b>T<sub>0</sub> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; k &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; T<sub>1</sub>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; T<sub>2</sub> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; T<sub>k</sub></b></i>
<br><br>
This rule means that task number <i><b>T<sub>0</sub></b></i> depends on
<i><b>k</b></i> tasks 
<i><b>T<sub>1</sub>, T<sub>2</sub>, ..., T<sub>k</sub></b></i>
(we say that task <i><b>T<sub>0</sub></b></i> is the <i>target</i>
and <i><b>T<sub>1</sub>,...,T<sub>k</sub></b></i> are <i>dependents</i>).

<p>
Note that tasks numbers are separated by single spaces
and that rules end with a newline.
Rules can appear in any order, but each task can appear as target
only once.

<p>
Your program can assume that there are no circular dependencies in the
rules, i.e. no task depends directly or indirectly on itself.

Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>
<b>
For each test case, the output must follow the description below.
The outputs of two consecutive cases will be separated by a blank line.
</b>
<p>
<p>
<p>
The output should be a single line
with the permutation of the tasks <i><b>1 ... N</b></i> to be performed,
ordered by dependencies (i.e. no task should appear before others
that it depends on).

<p>
To avoid ambiguity in the output, tasks that do not depend on each
other should be ordered by their number (lower numbers first).
